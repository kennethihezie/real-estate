					<description><![CDATA[Hey hey.  Hows it going?  I deffinately aggree with your take on needing to having a &quot;steady stream&quot; of leads coming in.

Leads are the life and blood of your business.  Statistics show that out of about 300 leads 30 of them will buy what you are selling and 3 of them will stick around with you.  You need to have  a lot of leads :)]]></description>
