					<description><![CDATA[excellent post.  As much as I believe that the Internet is an esanstiel part of a REALTORSc2ae marketing process, there is no substitute for the one on one interaction, that goes on between agent and client, when it comes to finding the right home for a buyer.  This is also true for selling homes because there is so much more to selling a home than just putting up a sign and accepting offers.Our jobs as REALTORSc2ae is to make the process seem easy and stress free, even though we tend to work exceptionally long hours and with few days of, or holidays to speak of, and our stress levels can be very high due to the uncertain nature of the industry and how we are paid.  There is nothing like knowing that, if you don&#039;t bust your butt, you may not have a pay cheque for months, if ever, to increase your stress levels.  It is true that the general public is doing more of their own research.  However, this often makes our job as educators even harder because of all the poor quality or incomplete information that is available, such as Zestimates that tend to be significantly over or under valued.  There is much more to real estate than a few statistics that can be pulled up on the Internet, and tips that work in one area may not be beneficial in others.  Thanks for your great post:)]]></description>
