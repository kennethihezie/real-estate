					<description><![CDATA[Inspiration is the one that really sticks out.  You can&#039;t get that feeling by staying home, you don&#039;t truly feel it through a webinar; there&#039;s magic when real estate professionals get into a room and inspire one another.  It&#039;s my favorite part and biggest take away.

Looking forward to Keller Williams Family Reunion in February to get inspired once again!!]]></description>
