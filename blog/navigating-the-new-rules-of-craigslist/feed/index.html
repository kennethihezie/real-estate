					<description><![CDATA[I recruit for picker packers and scum to fill orders for our clients..  I used to use craigslist to attract them -  its a shame that they took it all away.  while my wife pays the mortgage, I have to come up with electricity bill each month - its getting hard to even do that.  FU Craigslist.
