					<description><![CDATA[My husband and I want to buy our first house together early next year. I appreciate the advice for new homebuyers that you compiled here.

					<description><![CDATA[Now that prices have adjusted, it is still a good idea to have purchase  agreement contingent upon it appraising at the full purchase price.  If it doesn&#039;t for your buyers, most likely it won&#039;t for the next buyer on the listed property and the sellers will usually renegotiate the price down to the lower appraised price.  This would only apply if the appraisal is too low, if it is higher, great,  and there is no need to let the seller know anything except that it is &quot;ok&quot;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Tip # 7:  Know what your home will cost you on a monthly and yearly basis. A home is not a one time expense.  It is important to know and plan for these anticipated and unanticipated ongoing expenses. Anticipated expenses include your mortgage payment, utilities, Taxes, Insurance, (If applicable HOA fees) and Services (such as lawn and landscape, pest control, and swimming pools). Homes age and things wear out so it is important to factor in putting aside reserves for repairs &#038; replacements such as repainting, new roofing, appliances and systems.]]></description>
