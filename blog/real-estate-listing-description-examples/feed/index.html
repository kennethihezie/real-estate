					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketleader.com/blog/real-estate-listing-description-examples/#comment-426&quot;&gt;IndyREX&lt;/a&gt;.

Real Estate agents run into all sorts of different houses to sell.  As such, some houses have a lot of features to call out and some don&#039;t.  In reading this article I was searching for a study that reported an order of effectiveness for what has the most impact IF it is available to say.  In other words, some houses have new improvements to call out and some have few or none.  What is more important, mentioning improvements or flowery descriptive language?

We are investors who make so many new improvements to our homes that they will not all fit in the limited space allowed for MLS descriptions.  We have decided that it is (or should be) more important to list the improvements. For example:
 
&quot;Complete REMODEL with ALL following NEW: Roof, Air conditioning system, shaker cabinets throughout, cabinet knobs, granite counters, 4 sinks, 4 faucets, bath hardware, toilets, tiled walk-in shower, new tub &#038; tile surround, all electrical outlets &#038; switches, all light fixtures, 4 ceiling fans with remote controls, front and back doors, garage doors and remote opener, exterior and interior paint (including all walls, ceilings, doors, and trim), all new landscaping and major trees trimmed.&quot;

To a non-buyer these are boring facts.  But is a true buyer more affected by these improvement facts or flowery language?  This is an honest question since the subconscious of a buyer plays a part of her thinking as does her conscious thinking.

What do you think?  Should we delete some improvements to add some flowery language?]]></description>

Go to SBCadvice.com. They teach agents to write very effective descriptions. The technique they teach actually sold a home in less than half the time and for 3% more money, compared to 3 other homes of the same floor plan in the same neighborhood that sold the same season.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for pointing out that when it comes to real estate listings it&#039;s important to not be repetitive or boring. I think that having a home listing service could help you with this since they could help you with more localized descriptions and listings.

					<description><![CDATA[The property description is a great place to reaffirm both building and local amenities. Consider highlighting a few of the key “stand-out” amenities using positive descriptive phrases.
This is not a place to include a laundry list of all features and specifications.
Keep it short and sharp.
If the building itself is uninteresting, then focus on the submarket and access to transportation and surrounding points of interest.]]></description>
