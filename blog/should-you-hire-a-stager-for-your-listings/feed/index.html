					<description><![CDATA[Oops, stepping on toes, never fun. She was given a job, a budget and developed a plan that fit the style and budget. I can see how moving things around after she&#039;s done could be seen as an insult. The items you brought in may or may not have followed the desgin concept she had laid out. BUT having said that, YOU are the listing agent and the over-riding goal is to get the house sold for the client. If you don&#039;t like what she did and have to move things around after, I would find another stager that you can work with.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am a stager and a realtor. I hired a stager to stage a very large house. I made some adjustments to Staging, moved a few things, brought in accessories to add more color. Stager was angry and put it all back the way it was. Said I was not allowed to do that. Nor was I allowed to bring my inventory into empty rooms we did not have budget to stage. How should this be handled?]]></description>
