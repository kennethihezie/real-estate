					<description><![CDATA[I drop a leave a response when I especially enjoy a post on a site or if I have something to add to the discussion.
It is triggered by the fire communicated in the post I browsed.
And on this post How to sell real estate: Make a lasting first impression &#124; Market Leader.
I was moved enough to leave a comment :-P I actually do have 2 questions for you
if you do not mind. Could it be just me or does it look as if like
some of these remarks appear as if they are left by
brain dead individuals? :-P And, if you are writing at additional online social sites, I would like to keep up with you.

Would you list all of all your public pages like your Facebook page, twitter feed, or linkedin profile?]]></description>
