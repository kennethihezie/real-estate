					<description><![CDATA[Great article Jason!

I really recommend that agents have at least 5-6 different types of lead capture on their websites.  Just a simple sign up bar isn&#039;t doing it any more.  You can easily ad header lead capture devices and popups with Wordpress sites.  And can honestly engage your audience a lot better.

Sure, lead capture on IDX is great. But having it pervasive across your entire site is a really powerful things too.

Great read, look forward to the next one.
