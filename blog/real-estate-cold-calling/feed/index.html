					<description><![CDATA[We have found texting to be a more responsive way of communicating with our clients/prospects.  It allows us to build up to them actually feeling comfortable in speaking with us.  It kinda breaks the ice.  Times sure have changed!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Shannon,

It&#039;s interesting you found 10-2pm is the best time to call. In our market, Knoxville, Tennessee, we found that 3-7pm was much more beneficial. However, a majority of the population works 9-5 and doesn&#039;t answer their phone at work. 

What are your thoughts?]]></description>
