					<description><![CDATA[I was on the fence about software and online lead generation because I had been burned in the past. I spoke to a friend of mine and he told me of a company called moneytreeleadsystems.com and they built me a personalized site with a contact management system. It&#039;s like using the top lead gen system with the top contact management system at the same time for a lower cost than both! HAHA! These guys are awesome and if your looking then I suggest at least checking them out. Feel free to email me with any questions and if I can&#039;t answer I&#039;ll put you in touch with them myself. ]]></description>
