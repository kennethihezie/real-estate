Now he wants me and the other investor to pay off all the debts after he positioned himself to make maximum commissions then lied and said he wasn&#039;t going to pay off any of the debt, this man is pure Evil..I hope he burns now and burns in Hell..he really deserves it after all he has put me through. There has to be justice.this man devil beeds his licenses revoked so he can never hurt anothet human being as long as his miserable life goes]]></description>
