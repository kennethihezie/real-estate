					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s a given that you might use an accountant, doctor or hairstylist a few times during the year, they are not helping you make what is likely the largest purchase of your life. The one time commission the agent makes will also be substantial. Since they are forbidden from giving clients cash gifts, they could show their appreciation with a nice house-warming type gift. 
Then when their friends are over and comment on the beautiful plant, they will tell them that their Realtor gave it to them when they moved in.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketleader.com/blog/real-estate-closing-gifts/#comment-43059&quot;&gt;Jade&lt;/a&gt;.

great answer Jade. My name is Terry Carter. If you are interested in looking at other closing options, my sons and I offer quality options for great realtors in the NC market. We are just a startup, but are looking to partner with realtors, not looking for a seller/customer relationship. Our company has personalized, high quality gifts that your buyer will remember. Thanks and keep up the good work.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ours gave us KFC.  Although I appreciate the thought and understand they were trying to not have me make dinner...we had a huge hiccup at closing.
We do not eat things like that, and I feel like their money was wasted.  They were our buying and selling agent.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I disagree - being a real estate agent is about developing relationships, both online and offline.  

Ensuring your sincerity of developing the relationship, working with your clients for x-amount of time, helping them find their dream home, etc. - a closing gift can be a small token of your appreciation.  Here is a list of gift ideas to consider: https://blog.homespotter.com/2016/07/28/25-brilliant-closing-gift-ideas-for-homebuyers/ 

On a personal level, when we bought our first home our agent gave us a closing gift (one of the cheapest listed in the article).  From the relationship we developed over the time spent together and that closing gift, we gave her 5, yes five, referrals in 12 months.  It&#039;s worth doing an A/B test to see the effects on some clients.]]></description>
