Very true, they certainly picked the wrong photo to use as an example. I&#039;ve found that I always look at the verticals in photos. Even the Royal Wedding of Prince Harry had horrible verticles!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Although this is a good article with interesting facts, the &#039;After&#039; photos are lacking in quality. The converging verticals and distortion is pretty bad. It looks like a wide angle lens was used, but correction software was not. I much prefer the straight lines of the &#039;Before&#039; photos. Anyway, thanks for the article.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In doing &quot;dog-and-pony shows&quot; in agent office meetings, I was often asked, &quot;what do we need YOU for? After all,&quot; they&#039;d say, whipping out their iPhone, &quot;we&#039;ve all got cameras!&quot; I had a million answers till I hit on the right one:

&quot;I&#039;ve got as many answers to THAT question as YOU do to the question &#039;what do we need YOU for? After all, WE can fill in a contract!&#039;&quot;

That said, sunshine does NOT make for a better picture, as looking at the video above would seem to suggest: the &quot;after&quot; photos are just as bad as the originals! Since when do exterior walls go up at an angle? Most houses I&#039;ve seen, they&#039;re parallel with each other and perpendicular to the ground! Whoever took those photos should invest in corrective software and/or a lens that lets them take close-up photos from a greater distance ... and anyone promoting their work should NOT use them as &quot;examples&quot; of what they can &quot;do&quot; for an agent with a bad camera!]]></description>

Great article, couldn&#039;t have said it better myself. It&#039;s shocking to see some realtors with a million dollar listing in their hand yet the are nickel an diming for $50! I invest in myself and my business I can&#039;t understand this way of thinking?]]></description>
