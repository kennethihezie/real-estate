										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you’re making social connections at a party or interviewing for a new job, ﬁrst impressions are everything. And when it comes to real estate leads, ﬁrst impressions are more than just important—they’re crucial to your success.</p>
<p>In the real estate industry, much time is spent focusing on the strategy behind building your brand, generating leads, negotiating, and closing sales. But what about the part in between ﬁnding leads and negotiating sales? What about the period of time when you’ve already found the lead, but you haven’t yet started building the relationship?</p>
<p>Making a ﬁrst impression with potential clients is so much more than just returning phone calls and cleaning out your inbox. Your ﬁrst impression can help a potential client start to trust you, establish you as an expert in your local market, and secure your role as his or her real estate professional. Consider these tips for a successful ﬁrst encounter with a future client:</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">1. Respond Quickly—“Speed to Lead” Is Essential</h2>
<p>Between social media, online shopping, and information at the push of a button, today’s consumer expects fast, eﬃcient service. This why speed to lead is so important in real estate. The quicker you respond to emails, phone calls, texts, new online leads, social media messages, and Zillow messages, the more likely you are to convert that lead into a client.</p>
<hr style="border-top: 1px solid #41464D; border-width: 1px; margin: 20px 0px;" />
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Keep in mind:</span></h3>
<h4>• 86% of leads believe response time is “extremely important” when choosing their agent.</h4>
<h4>• You’re 100x more likely to reach a lead than if you respond in 5 minutes versus 1 hour.</h4>
<h4>• 31% of leads expected a real estate agent to reply instantly to their online inquiry.</h4>
<hr style="border-top: 1px solid #41464D; border-width: 1px; margin: 20px 0px;" />
<h2 class="BlogH2">2. Pick up the Phone Whenever Possible</h2>
<p>If a lead contacts you via telephone, <strong>do not let it go to voicemail</strong> unless you are with a client. Many consumers won’t leave you a message and will move on to another agent if you don’t answer their call right away. If you are away or with a client, be sure to either text or set up an away message that says you will be in contact shortly.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">3. Respond in the Same Way That Leads Contact You</h2>
<p>People reach out to you in a way that is most comfortable and eﬃcient for them, so it can be beneﬁcial to respect their choice when contacting them for the ﬁrst time. It’s long been a best practice to respond back in the manner that the lead reached out to you. If a contact sends you an email, respond via email. If he or she sends you a text message, text back and then suggest a phone call. If someone reaches out on the phone, call back.</p>
<p>However, data is increasingly showing that response time is the most important factor in converting online leads. If comes down to a decision of quick response or responding in the same manner as the lead reached out, go with speed. Your pipeline will thank you for it.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">4. Make Sure Leads Know How To Contact You</h2>
<p>Give leads multiple ways to get in contact with you—by phone, text, email, or social media to make it most convenient for them. You want to show them that you are available and ready to address any of their needs.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">5. Prove Your Value From the Very Beginning</h2>
<p>Balance the need to respond as quickly as possible and respond with the information the potential client is looking for. If possible, have all relevant information in front of you. Prove your value and expertise from the very ﬁrst conversation. Leave your lead with information he or she didn’t have before the call &#8212; a CMA, school district information, a listing detail, or other valuable materials.</p>
<p>If you are out and not able to collect the information requested, contact the lead right away and let them know that you are collecting the information that they’re looking for, but that you are happy to answer any other questions they may have. Then, follow-up on your word and get back to them as soon as you can with the other requested information.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">6. Have Your Own List of Questions</h2>
<p>Your new lead will likely have a list of questions for you. But, make sure you have questions prepared for them. What are they looking for in a home? What makes now the right time to buy or sell? What are their must-haves? Are they a ﬁrst–time buyer or seller?</p>
<p>Asking questions that allow you to best serve them will work wonders for both of you. They&#8217;ll feel valued and like you truly care about what is important to them, and having as much information as possible will allow you to work smarter and faster for them.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">7. Consider That There May Be Multiple Decision Makers</h2>
<p>In most real estate transactions there are multiple people tasked with making a decision, whether it’s a couple, family members, parents helping their children buy a ﬁrst home, or friends buying a vacation property together. Make sure you know who is involved so that you don’t overlook important parties.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">8. Respect Their Schedule</h2>
<p>Yes, your new lead is looking to buy or sell a home. But they also have other things going on in their lives. If you pick up the phone to call a lead and he or she sounds busy, ask, “Can I call you back at a time that is more convenient for you?” Then, always call back at the agreed-upon time.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">9. Be Patient</h2>
<p>When a contact reaches out to you, it doesn’t always mean he or she is ready to buy or sell today. In some cases, it takes over a year for a lead to become active. The way you approach and handle ﬁrst contact tells your lead a lot about the way you do business—if you&#8217;re pushy and aggressive, they’ll work with someone else.</p>
<p>Never brush oﬀ a lead that isn&#8217;t transaction-ready. Take the time to answer their questions, build the foundation for a relationship, and nurture them until they want to buy or sell a home with you. Consider it an investment in your future business.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">10. Ensure All Your Leads Are in Your CRM</h2>
<p>Once you hang up the phone or click send, take the time to enter your new lead into your <a href="/products/professional-for-agents/">real estate CRM</a>, if they aren’t in it already. Keeping track of every single lead helps you manage your leads and nurture them until they’re ready to buy or sell.</p>
<p>Remember that you’re not just selling a home, you’re selling yourself and the partnership you provide your clients.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.295; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Roboto,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Successful businesses implement strategies and processes to dominate their markets. In the real estate industry, solid lead generation and detailed follow up strategies will draw a line in the sand to separate you from the competition.</span></p>
<h1 dir="ltr">The Big Real Estate Challenge</h1>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.295; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Roboto,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The biggest challenge agents face is the follow-up. Why? The consumer timeline is often neglected for home buyers and sellers because of the long sales-cycle, with  most transactions closing 12-18 months after they begin their buying or sales journey. As such, frustration with leads is common because initial contact is often not made after an agent’s first time contacting the consumer. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.295; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Roboto,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The average time that an agent will follow up with a lead is only 1-2 times and 44% of salespeople give up after one follow up attempt. Of all real estate leads received, up to 71% are never followed up with.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.295; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Roboto,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> It takes 3-5 phone calls to get a real estate lead to engage, respond and for an agent to make an impact.  Timing is also extremely important in terms of lead follow up. According to Forbes, “the odds of contacting a new lead are extremely high if you call within the first 5 minutes of submission. The odds drop off dramatically by the first 30 minutes.” After the 30-minute mark, contact is 100X less likely to be made which is why response time is everything! </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.295; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Roboto,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Clearly lead follow-up is a challenge in the real estate industry, but implementing a plan for every lead to receive multiple touches is an easy change to make in your lead generation strategy. </span><b id="docs-internal-guid-a920cbc5-7fff-a8e7-45be-bed6c7218112" style="font-weight: normal;"></b></p>
<h1>Your Plan: If it&#8217;s not Measurable, it&#8217;s not Repeatable</h1>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.295; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Roboto,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Agents who do well with digital lead generation have a very meticulous strategy for a variety of scenarios. Establish a lead generation strategy for your business to capture and convert leads  in a way that’s both manageable and repeatable. </span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">1. Online Leads</h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.295; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Roboto,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Purchased leads are the beginning of the lead generation process. At this step you cannot discount any lead as a bad lead. As we mentioned earlier, no response from a lead after your first contact attempt is a common frustration for agents. The reality is, ever lead should be cared tended to with the same amount of attention. The real estate sales cycle is a long one and, according to NAR, most consumers work with the first agent the talk to&#8211;so discarding a lead who isn’t responsive at first could cost you a full pipeline down the road.</span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">2. The Follow-Up</h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.295; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Roboto,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">As soon as you get a new lead, you should respond immediately with a call, text, or email. Send a quick response to let them know you are working on getting them more information from their request. You need to do this as soon as possible to prevent them from filling out forms requesting the same information on other platforms&#8211;i.e., opening lines of communication with other agents. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.295; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Roboto,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">If you don’t provide value or set yourself apart from the start, consider the ball dropped! </span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">3. Consistency is Everything</h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.295; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Roboto,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Consistent follow-up makes the biggest impact on a consumer’s real estate journey. Work out a replicable system to follow up everyday for the first 10 days. After your initial outreach, spend time to work on a market report for a buyer or a detailed CMA for a seller. Send the lead an email with the documents and print a copy to mail along with a handwritten thank you note. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.295; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Roboto,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">After your first response and additional relevant information is sent, the rest of the 10-day period is crucial for follow-up. Be patient because the sweet spot for a lead to convert is typically between 4-6 months. Build your pipeline for the <a href="/journey">consumer journey</a> and show commitment to each lead because remember… there’s no such thing as a bad lead!</span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">4. Stop Their Search</h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.295; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Roboto,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The long sales cycle in real estate can be problematic for impatient agents. At a certain point, some agents write leads off out of frustration from lack of response or willingness to meet. Not giving the lead enough attention or being too aggressive right off the bat won’t stop their search for an agent, it will only wedge you further away from them. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.295; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Roboto,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Most leads aren’t ready to talk to an agent right away (let alone meet with one), so why continue to reach out? To provide value. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.295; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Roboto,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Keep in mind people are creatures of habit and, through providing valuable information, you can prevent them from unsubscribing or filling out online forms from your competition because they’re already getting the information they need from you. Whether they’re responding yet or not, if they haven’t unsubscribed, they’re interested.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.295; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Roboto,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Stop their search by driving them back to your website through your marketing campaigns, eliminating their need to search for information elsewhere. Providing all the value you can while you establish their timeline and demographic to better target them with listing alerts, drip campaigns or market reports. Through those methods, you will EARN the right to meet the lead in person and help them throughout the remainder of their consumer journey. </span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">5. Learn from Your Mistakes</h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.295; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Roboto,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Perfect your lead generation strategy by taking the time to learn from your mistakes. Establish a detailed process and target your contacts to build momentum for your business. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.295; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Roboto,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">As Tom Ferry says, “Every lead deserves love.” Take the time to slow down and approach a new lead with a 100mph sales pitch. Nurture the lead and provide relevant information consistently until they’re ready for the next step. You can’t impact the consumer timeline unless you&#8217;re guiding them through it. </span></p>
