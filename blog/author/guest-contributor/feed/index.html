										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright  wp-image-22131" title="social media for real estate" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/social-media-and-real-estate.jpg" alt="Pinterest and Google Plus are two social networks that are ideal for real estate agents" width="305" height="204" />One of the major goals of any social media strategy is to get more visitors to your website. It is a long process, often referred to as the tortoise of marketing (slow and steady wins the race!), because you have to take the time to grow your follower base and build a strong bond with them.</p>
<p>Pinterest and Google Plus are goldmines of website traffic because their target audiences (home décor fanatics and web-savvy professionals) are more likely to enjoy and interact with  real estate-related posts. Oddly enough, Pinterest and Google Plus are two of the most underrated social media sites for real estate agents. This article explores why you should beef up your online marketing strategy by using these two powerful social networks.</p>
<h2>How Real Estate Agents Should Use Google Plus<strong></strong></h2>
<p>Here are some pointers for agents interested in using Google Plus:</p>
<h3>Set Up Google Authorship</h3>
<p>Set up <strong>Google Authorship</strong> on your Google Plus profile and your blog to link the two together. The primary benefit of Google Authorship is that your Google Plus profile picture shows up next to your blog posts in search results. This leads to a much higher click-through rate; having images next to your blog posts in search results will attract users’ eyes and can garner as high as a <a href="http://www.seobodybuilder.com/marketing-conversion/click-through-rate-increased-with-rel-author/">38 percent uptick</a> in the number of times your posts get clicked!</p>
<h3>How to Get Engagement on Google Plus</h3>
<p>There is a right way and a wrong way of using social media for real estate. In fact, one of the biggest social media mistakes Realtors® make is just blogging about real estate listings on Google Plus.</p>
<p>As a social community Google Plus happens to be one of the most intelligent. The conversations you see on Google Plus are a little different than those on Facebook. Those that get the most engagement on Google Plus are sharing awe-inspiring content. A humdrum post about a real estate listing is not the kind of content that is going to make people want to interact with you.</p>
<h2>How Real Estate Agents Should Use Pinterest</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft  wp-image-22171" title="Pinterest for real estate" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Pinterest-219x300.jpg" alt="How real estate agents should use Pinterest" width="83" height="114" />Pinterest users are crazy about interior decorating, home improvement projects, and other home-related topics. This makes them the perfect audience for real estate agents using social media to generate traffic to their websites.</p>
<p>A great feature of Pinterest is that its posts, called “pins,” are easy for Pinterest users – and even search engine browsers – to find weeks or even months after they are originally posted. Compared to Twitter, where tweets get buried in your followers’ feeds in minutes and are rarely seen in search results, Pinterest has the potential to drive a lot more traffic to your website.</p>
<p><strong>Follow these simple tips to drive traffic to your website from Pinterest:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use intriguing images worthy of a <strong>“re-pin”</strong> (when another user reposts your pin). One way to get your hands on Pinterest-worthy images is to take pictures of interesting architecture and unique features in the homes you are selling. Pin these images and include links back to the listings on your website.</li>
<li>Create several <strong>“boards”</strong> (categories that your pins are classified into) related to homes and home life to give your followers a reason to frequently look at the images you post for ideas and inspiration. Other board topics that are ideal for the real estate industry are home improvement, mortgages/financing, and home staging.</li>
<li>Set up <a href="https://www.thesocialmediahat.com/blog/why-real-estate-agents-should-have-community-pages-and-how-to-promote-them/">boards for the communities</a> where you sell real estate. If you frequently post images on these boards and use community-specific keywords in the titles, descriptions and image captions, these boards can show up in Google searches related to the communities they target.</li>
<li>Consider using <strong>&#8220;rich pins&#8221;</strong> to enhance the quality of your posts by adding information not included in typical pins. Unfortunately, Pinterest users must be comfortable tinkering with HTML code using Schema.org markup or Open Graph tags to create rich pins. For more information, Pinterest offers a guide on <a href="https://help.pinterest.com/en/business/article/rich-pins">creating rich pins</a> (including using the markup languages they require).</li>

<h2>Benefits of Using Pinterest and Google Plus Together</h2>
<p>Here’s why you should use both Pinterest and Google Plus:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Images are similar on both networks.</strong> Images ideal for Pinterest will also work well on Google Plus. For the pictures you post on these networks, consider adding your watermark for added branding opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hashtags are similar on both networks.</strong> The most popular hashtag on Pinterest, #pinoftheday, is also commonly used on Google Plus.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Get double the exposure with people using both networks.</strong>  By maintaining an active presence on both Google Plus and Pinterest, you double your chances of being found and driving traffic to your website.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Connect with different demographics.</strong> Not all Pinterest users are on Google Plus, and vice versa. Maintaining a presence on both networks will give you a wider reach than if you only use one.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Post on Both Social Networks</h2>
<p>There are many different strategies to use when combining Pinterest and Google Plus. Here are a few:</p>
<p><strong>Rock the simultaneous post.</strong> Apps like Everypost allow social media users to simultaneously create and publish posts on all their accounts with major social media platforms. These applications are great time-savers and are ideal for posting on Google Plus and Pinterest because images and hashtags operate in similar fashions on both networks.</p>
<p><strong>Have Pinterest be your guinea pig.</strong> Test images on Pinterest to see how popular they have the potential to be. If your images don’t get any interaction on Pinterest, skip posting them on Google Plus and test other images instead. Why use Pinterest as a guinea pig? Pinterest users are barraged with images the moment they log in; any image that inspires interaction on Pinterest will likely do the same on Google Plus!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Building your brand across various social media platforms has many advantages to your business. As a real estate agent, it&#8217;s important to get your listings out to as many people as possible. Also, it&#8217;s important that people know where they can find you so they can look up information about your company, consider the services you offer, and find a way to contact you.</p>
<p>With that said, here are six Realtor® branding tips every agent should take to heart in order to build a prominent brand across a variety of social media platforms.</p>
<h2>Connect to Your Potential Clients Through Facebook</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-20231" title="Social media branding for Realtors" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/social-media-for-realtors-217x300.jpg" alt="Realtors can use social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter to brand themselves" width="217" height="300" />Facebook is a great tool for real estate agents. Whether you reach out to family and friends to get referrals or connect to potential clients, Facebook is perfect for expanding your network. When using Facebook, it&#8217;s important not to come across as too much of a salesperson. <strong>Instead of forcing yourself on potential clients by bombarding them with Facebook messages about your business, take part in natural conversations and let those conversations lead into the services you offer.</strong></p>
<p>Never post status messages like, &#8220;I&#8217;m taking new clients, so call me now.&#8221; Instead, take the &#8220;top of mind/awareness&#8221; approach by posting, &#8220;I&#8217;m grateful to have so many great clients.&#8221; You could also post pictures of your home listings with comments like, &#8220;Super excited about this new house – could you live here?&#8221; Whatever the case, remain strategic and consider how your audience perceives you.</p>
<p>As far as networking goes, make sure to tag your sellers in the home pictures you post on your Facebook page. This is a great way to open yourself to their networks. Also, try posting messages directly on your seller’s wall so other people can see who you are. Anyone who&#8217;s interested will add you to their list.</p>
<p>Depending on your strategy (branding your business vs. branding yourself), it might be best if you <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/5492/how-to-create-a-facebook-business-page-in-5-simple-steps-with-video.aspx">set up a business page</a> in addition to your personal account. You&#8217;ll be able to use it for posts more directly associated with selling homes. However, keep in mind that you don&#8217;t want to be too sales-oriented here either. <strong>Offer information that&#8217;s engaging and useful, and the sales are more likely to follow.</strong></p>
<p>Much of agent Jenelle Isaacson&#8217;s clientele are single women, and Facebook provides a channel where she can connect with them.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-21111" title="Realtor branding on Facebook" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Real-estate-agent-Facebook.png" alt="Realtor Jenelle Isaacson brands herself as an alternative, single-women-friendly agent on Facebook" width="545" height="350" /></p>
<h2>Promote Yourself Through YouTube</h2>
<p>YouTube is often overlooked when it comes to social media networks because it isn&#8217;t like the other more traditional platforms. To attract more business, simply start filming all of your home listings and post them on your YouTube account. When filming and posting the videos, be sure to highlight any details of the home listing and use proper keywords to attract potential leads. If done right, people who search Google will run into your YouTube video listings.</p>
<p>When it comes to YouTube, making your video title rich in keywords can be crucial for search engine recognition and possibly even for <a href="https://searchengineland.com/five-keys-for-creating-viral-youtube-titles-37989">making it go viral</a>. For example, if your listing is in New York, make your title &#8220;New York Real Estate – (insert listing address).&#8221; This will drive more traffic to your website and boost your ranking within Google search results.</p>
<p><em>Here&#8217;s an excellent example of how an agent can brand themselves in a unique way and market their services all while having fun and entertaining potential clients:</em><br />
<iframe loading="lazy" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/37mxqjBNEnU" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<h2>Reach Locals via Twitter</h2>
<p>Although time-consuming, Twitter works well if you&#8217;re trying to reach a local audience. In order to reach a sufficiently broad local audience, you need to get followers!</p>
<p>To build a healthy following of locals, look at who is following your local celebrities, radio DJs, restaurants, Rotary clubs, and any other personalities or organizations in your city. These types of profiles will almost always have a local following of people. Once you&#8217;ve found the locals, follow them.<strong> Following locals on Twitter that you haven&#8217;t met in real life amounts to a virtual handshake &#8211; and gives you the opportunity to have your brand make an impression on them!</strong></p>
<p>Once the person has noticed that you&#8217;ve followed them, they&#8217;ll likely click on your profile and website to see who you are. Not only does this bring traffic to your site, but people who see value in your service will start following you, allowing you to expand your network to even more people on Twitter. <a href="https://www.marketingcharts.com/digital-26962">Twitter users also tend to be more engaged with brands</a> than Facebook users, and they&#8217;re more open to making connections with people (and companies) that they don&#8217;t already know.</p>
<p>The below picture is a perfect example of how an agent can use Twitter to connect themselves and brand their business.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-21101" title="Real estate branding on Twitter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Real-estate-agent-Twitter.png" alt="Perfect example of how a Realtor can brand themselves on Twitter" width="557" height="250" /></p>
<h2>Talk With Other Professionals on LinkedIn</h2>
<p>After signing up for LinkedIn, the first thing you should do is optimize your public profile. After that, get active in various groups that are associated with the real estate industry. Additionally, you can start your own group to attract other people in your area. By starting a group or joining one, you increase the chance of referrals.</p>
<p><strong>Not only do you have the ability to contact potential clients through LinkedIn, but you also have access to other professionals within the industry who can point you in the right direction.</strong> Either way, by using LinkedIn, you&#8217;re increasing your brand&#8217;s recognition and expanding your network.</p>
<h2>Drive Online Traffic to Your Blog</h2>
<p>While maintaining an online blog isn&#8217;t a necessity, you should consider hosting one on your site so you have a central hub from which you can create content, and to which you can drive traffic from social media. Having a blog is a great way to not only drive online traffic to a specific place (from your other social media accounts), but to showcase your online marketing efforts as well.</p>
<p>If nothing else, blogs are by far the best places for Realtors with active web presences to publish content.</p>
<h2>Make Social Media Easier With HootSuite</h2>
<p><em>Here&#8217;s a quick introduction to the powerful &#8211; and free &#8211; social media tool called HootSuite:</em></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/t9vs0PfgXsc" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe><br />
HootSuite combines all of your social media accounts into one platform. This makes it easier for you to reach out to people and network with them on a consistent basis. <strong>If you don&#8217;t want to sign in to five different accounts to spread your message, consider using HootSuite.</strong> It&#8217;ll help you build your brand while saving you time and energy.</p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: Market Leader&#8217;s social media gurus use HootSuite extensively and can attest to how powerful and efficient a tool it is!</em></p>
<p>If you want to be successful in the real estate business, it&#8217;s important to <a href="https://thelogocompany.net/how-to-market-and-brand-your-real-estate-business/">build your brand</a>. With more people using social media to communicate and learn about new companies, it&#8217;s time for you to sign up and take advantage.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/realtor-brand-building-on-social-media/">6 Tips for Realtors® to Build Brand Across Social Media Platforms</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>
