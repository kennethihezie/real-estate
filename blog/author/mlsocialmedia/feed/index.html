										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With ONLY SIX WEEKS LEFT in 2010, just about everyone has started thinking about what’s ahead for next year in real estate. While no one here at Market Leader has a crystal ball, it’s fairly certain that the market will continue to change and shift in 2011.</p>
<p>Savvy agents know they need to start planning <strong><em>now</em></strong> to build their pipeline of prospective business in order to capture the opportunities out there.  And make no mistake…opportunities <strong><em>will</em></strong> be out there for the agent who looks for them in 2011. Here’s what you may look forward to next year: </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Stress sales may decline.</strong> Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody&#8217;s Economy.com, told Inman News he believes foreclosures will decline in 2011. Fewer foreclosures could bring better balance to many markets<em>.
<p></em></li>
<li><strong>More and better buyers.</strong> What’s more, consumers may be getting through the worst of their own financial crises. According to Richard Berner, co-head of global economics for Morgan Stanley in New York (via Bloomberg), households are reducing their debts and building savings faster than he anticipated.  This may position more consumers to take advantage of what continue to be historically low mortgage rates<em>.  
<p></em></li>
<li><strong>More competition.</strong> While the numbers of licensed agents may not grow in 2011, the agents who are still in the business are becoming increasingly smarter about using online marketing. This means you’ll see more agents using low- or no-cost tools like social media, and it will be harder to stand out. It’s then essential that you <strong><em>capture</em></strong> <strong><em>leads and business</em></strong> from your social media and online presence. Put a bottom to the sack, so to speak.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>So… do you feel ready for 2011?</strong></p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/what-can-we-expect-from-the-real-estate-market-in-2011/">What Can We Expect from the Real Estate Market in 2011?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/help-local-buyers-and-sellers-find-you-on-your-website/">Help Local Buyers and Sellers Find YOU…on YOUR Website!</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have a great website, but are not doing anything to drive prospective buyers and sellers to it…it’s like having the <strong>world’s best billboard in the middle of the desert</strong>.  Who cares if no one can find it? Can your website create any “noise” or leads if no one even knows it’s there? Of course not.  </p>
<p>Make sure you’re capturing opportunities for free or low-cost…so there’s no excuse not to do them:</p>
<p><strong>Email address</strong>. You’d be surprised how many people look to your email address to find your website. Don’t use @gmail.com or @yahoo.com free emails—<strong>use your own website domain</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Email signature</strong>. Your sig will remind recipients of the many ways they can reach you and your services. And if someone forwards an email from you to a friend, that friend will know where to find you, too.</p>
<p><strong>Open houses</strong>. Use sign-in sheets to capture email addresses, and send a “thank you for stopping by, come see my website for more listings” email.</p>
<p><strong>Listing flyers</strong>. ‘Nuff said. That includes flyers for open houses you’re hosting, or your own listings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These days, virtually all home owners expect you to use the Internet to market their home, in addition to traditional marketing. When talking with a prospect about listing their home, consider positioning yourself this way: </p>
<p>“I am an Internet-savvy real estate professional who knows how to harness the power of technology to market your home on the web and provide you with <strong>maximum exposure</strong>. My goal is to help you sell your home for the <strong>best price</strong>, in the <strong>shortest amount of time</strong>, with the <strong>least amount of inconvenience to you</strong>.”</p>
<p> Let the sellers know how you will provide them with a <strong>unique service advantage</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Detail the steps</strong> you will take to prepare the home for going on the market.</li>
<li><strong>Show a sample marketing calendar</strong> for the listing.
<ul>
<li>Send a “just listed” blast email to your entire prospect database—how many people are in your database? <strong>Tell the seller</strong>.</li>
<li>Email/call every buyer in your database who is interested in that price range.</li>
<li>Email other agents letting them know you just listed a new property.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create a sample flyer for your listing presentation—it helps the seller envision working with you.</li>
<li>At the conclusion, <strong>remember to ask for their business</strong>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">You don’t get what you don’t ask for</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>They key is to <strong>be as specific as you can</strong> in describing what you’ll do to market the home. This lends credibility to you and helps build trust. That way you’ll be able to <strong>convert more listing presentations into listings</strong>.</p>
<p>What other best practices do you use in your listing presentation?</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/nailing-the-listing-presentation/">Nailing the Listing Presentation</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

<p>Salespersons seem to be more analytical and reflective in the fourth quarter of the year. They look at performance sheets, seek tools to make them better, them make New Year’s Resolutions. (Why do you think the Realtors hold their annual convention in November?)</p>
<p>Some of them got a head start this year with the helpful Agent Reboot series sponsored by Inman News. These one-day marketing and technology seminars for brokers and agents stressed that making a difference in the neighborhood usually makes a difference in the pocketbook.</p>
<p>For example, attendees “got” the importance of social media when Dale Chumbley, an agent with <a href="https://prunw.com/">Prudential NW Properties</a> in Vancouver, Washington said social media for generated 40 percent of his business. His blog “365 Things to Do in Vancouver, Washington” has become a national model and features basic information about the Vancouver area without attempting to sell anything.</p>
<p>“It simply got people interested, and I listened,” Chumbley said. “It was a way for them to participate. For me, it could eventually become a way to meet a person face-to-face. That’s my goal with all social media – to eventually set up a face-to-face meeting.”</p>
<p>An important element of the Reboot series was that portions were aimed at social media non-believers and presented by former non-believers.</p>
<p>Michael McClure, chief executive of <a href="https://professionalone.com/">Professional One Realtors</a>, thought Twitter “was the dumbest, most narcissistic thing ever invented.’’ Now, 18 months later, it’s the backbone of his business.</p>
<p>“It’s all about consistent content creation,” McClure said. “It’s about relationships, not the transaction.”</p>
<p>When I started writing about reverse mortgages for seniors 10 years ago, the most successful loan reps said that industry was all about providing information and hand-holding with no expectations of an immediate transaction. Today’s residential real estate marketing is much the same.</p>
<p><em>Tom Kelly is a syndicated columnist and talk show host. His latest work “Bargains Beyond the Border” will soon be available.</em></p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/are-you-reboot-ing-your-real-estate-business-for-2011/">Are you "REBoot-ing" your real estate business for 2011?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the old days, real estate team leaders taught new members of their team how to market by simply replicating themselves, producing “mini me&#8217;s”. It’s understandable that agents used to imitate their leaders. I mean, you’ve already had enough success in your business to show that you are able to grow a team. So naturally, you&#8217;d think having another “you” would make your team twice as successful, right? Two heads are better than one, you can be in two places at the same time… and if you have two, three, a dozen team members who are just like you, you’ll close two, three, twelve times as much business, right?</p>
<p>If you scratch the surface, of course, you’ll see <strong>that’s not the case</strong> for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Individuals are just that—individuals unlike anyone else. <strong>Their strengths and weaknesses are not yours, so if they are doing the same thing you do, they will not be as efficient as you are.</strong> That’s just the way it goes.</li>
<li><strong>Specialization increases efficiencies.</strong> If you only have to juggle six hats instead of 12, that will make you much better at those six hats. And your team members can get better at their hats too.</li>
<li><strong>Customer service matters</strong> a lot in this business. When your team is specialized and coordinated, you’re able to provide better customer service than a single agent or team that’s trying to do everything for everybody. If real estate isn’t a service industry, then it’s a commodity. <strong>Set yourself apart by combining your resources across the team.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>So—you’re on board with the idea of letting your team specialize, right?  How to do it starts with getting to know the individual. When you interview and first bring them on board, <strong>identify core competencies</strong>. If they’re not the same as yours, all the better. <strong>Teach them the part of marketing that they need to know, and let the rest speak for itself.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Coordination</strong> is key. Set up processes and expectations to ensure information is shared throughout the team. This sounds more complicated than it is. Start by asking each team member to send a status email once a week, and schedule regular team meetings. Be proactive about reminding your team members of the process for the first few weeks, until it becomes a solid habit.</p>
<p><strong>Accountability</strong> is equally important. Make sure each team member specializes in a particular channel or audience. Ask them to document their plan, including specific goals and success criteria. Set quarterly reviews, just as you do for your business.</p>
<p>While all this coordination may seem like a chore, you may be glad to know it quickly becomes your strength—<strong>when you’re the “brains” behind the team, you need strong nerve connections to keep everyone in sync and focused on what’s most important.</strong> That way, your marketing will make a bigger, bolder impact.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/team-leaders-combine-resources-increase-marketing-impact/">Team Leaders: Combine Resources…Increase Marketing Impact</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You can’t avoid hearing all the buzz about social media these days. Many, many agents are jumping on the low- or no-cost opportunities available with social media—much to their early-adopter benefit. If you are a broker, cheering on your cutting-edge agents from the sidelines on isn’t enough.</p>
<p>The successful office needs to get and stay ahead in this exciting and new field. As the leader of your organization, <strong>you should care about social media—and need to lead the charge of educating your agents and helping them use it</strong>. Why?</p>
<p>1. <strong>Lead generation</strong> – The fact is, 9 out of 10 buyers search for homes online according to NAR. Today’s consumers increasingly use social media as the start to a real business relationship. Are they viable leads? Yes—as long as you build the relationship and use lead capture best practices on your website.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Relationship building</strong> &#8211; When your agents are at the forefront of social media, they are representing you—in a space where many brokerages still fear to tread—and building the relationship where consumers are, where they spend the most time thinking and acting on the early stages of their home search.</p>
<p>3. <strong>High ROI</strong> – The cost of Twitter, a blog, a Facebook page: nothing but a little bit of time. With upside like that, why not get your agents to do it?</p>
<p>4. <strong>Market share</strong> – It used to be that brokerage market share was determined block by block, “sold” sign by “sold” sign. Now brokerage territories are being carved out virtually via consumer mindshare. It’s the new frontier for competition, so by starting now you will be able to stake the biggest claim.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Pipeline</strong> – In real estate, it’s a numbers game, and s/he who has the most leads wins. Anything that helps grow your agents’ pipeline is valuable for your brokerage.</p>
<p>These are only the top five reasons—there are plenty of others. <strong>What are yours?</strong></p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/top-5-reasons-brokers-should-care-about-social-media/">Top 5 Reasons Brokers Should Care About Social Media</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>
