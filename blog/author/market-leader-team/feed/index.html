										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After learning some best practices, your new perspective on cold calling may surprise you.</p>
<p>It gets a bad rap. But if you know what you’re doing, it’s less intimidating and more productive.</p>
<p>Regardless of what you’ve heard or imagined, real estate cold calling can still be an effective lead generation strategy. That’s true even though it is “old school,” and even if there are many ways to fail.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Why Cold Calling Is Still Worthy of Consideration</h2>
<p>If real estate cold calling seems like an old-fashioned strategy, that’s because it is. But like <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/real-estate-direct-mail/">direct mail marketing</a> and <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/door-knocking-real-estate/">door knocking</a>, there’s a reason it’s been a common sales tactic for as long as it has: it works.</p>
<p>Let’s be honest. Upon first glance, the statistics about how good of an ROI cold calling offers aren’t encouraging. For example, <a href="https://www.zippia.com/advice/cold-calling-statistics/">a recent study</a> indicated that roughly one in three prospects will pick up when you call, and only one percent of cold calls will lead to an appointment.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t show the whole picture. Because many top-performing agents consider cold calling to be an essential part of their business plan. They’ve filled their pipelines by “dialing for dollars,” and it’s led to serious commission income increases year after year.</p>
<p>This discrepancy seems to highlight an important point: Real estate cold calling isn’t just a numbers game. Success comes as a result of discipline, hard work, and a bit of technique. Not plugging away until you experience some random luck.</p>
<p>Top-performing agents know how to capitalize on the few opportunities they get. They know how to get warm leads out of cold calls. And that’s doable for you, too, as long as you follow some tried-and-true techniques.</p>
<p>So let’s dive into the best practices so you can be among the many expert agents who leverage cold calling to close more deals.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">8 Pro Tips for Real Estate Cold Calling</h2>
<h3 class="BlogH3">1. Understand the Law</h3>
<p>Cold calling in real estate isn’t foolproof. There are many ways it can go wrong. Getting into legal trouble is among the worst ways to fail.</p>
<p>The Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TPCA) was created in 1991 to protect consumers from pesky telemarketers. It applies to “any person, business, or entity that conducts telephone solicitations,” which includes real estate agents.</p>
<p>The TCPA is important to mention here because both the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have the regulatory powers to enforce it. The last thing you want as a result of trying to generate leads is a lawsuit.</p>
<p>And beware: today there are more than 220 million numbers on the FCC’s official <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/topics/do-not-call-registry">Do Not Call Registry</a>. If you call numbers on the registry, you could face a fine of up to <a href="https://www.rd.com/list/truth-about-do-not-call-list/">$40,000</a> for each call.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for you? Essentially it means you need to comply with the following:</p>
<ul class="BlogUL">
<li class="BlogLI">Restrict your calls to hours between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Be transparent: immediately tell the recipient who you are and the name of your business</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Don’t block your phone number from the recipient’s caller I.D.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Search the registry for every cold call you make to ensure you aren’t contacting anyone who’s on that list</li>
</ul>
<p>For more details about how to cold call in real estate without breaking the law, <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/telemarketing-cold-calling">check out NAR’s quick summary</a>.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">2. Prepare</h3>
<p>Do the proper research before you call so you can speak knowledgeably about your prospect’s situation and provide thorough responses to any questions that might come up. For example: if you’re cold calling a potential seller, familiarize yourself with the neighborhood, know the area’s <a href="https://www.realtor.com/research/market-trends/">median listing price</a>, and compile a handful of nearby listing comps for reference.</p>
<p>Prepare your lines beforehand. Use <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2022-Call-Scripts-Guide.pdf">the most effective real estate call scripts</a> and adjust them to fit your personality and the specific situation.</p>
<p>Then practice. Rehearse your main talking points. Call yourself and leave a voicemail to assess your delivery.</p>
<p>Ask a friend, family member, or colleague to play the role of an inquisitive consumer so you can practice fielding questions, addressing concerns, and handling objections. Work toward sounding as natural as possible.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">3. Resist the Urge To Sell</h3>
<p>Be relational, not salesy. No one wants to feel like they’re being used to boost your bottom line. So be friendly and provide value. Demonstrate that you actually care about them as a person.</p>
<p>How can you do that? By listening to what they say, taking notes, and repeating their own words back to them throughout the conversation. Tailor your approach specifically to their pain points and show how you’re the agent who can provide the help they need.</p>
<p>Your ultimate goal, of course, is to turn them into a client. But that’s not what this call is about. You’re not going to sign any contracts after a single phone call.</p>
<p>Instead, focus on being genuinely helpful, and replace your ultimate goal with a much smaller one for the time being: to get them to take the next step (which, for example, might be something as simple as scheduling a follow-up call).</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">4. Set a (Realistic) Daily Cold Calling Goal</h3>
<p>Aiming for 500 cold calls a day is admirable, but it’s also a recipe for burnout.</p>
<p>First, establish your commission income goals. Then determine how many calls you’ll need to get there.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say you want to earn $75,000 this year in commissions and you’re on a 10 percent split with your broker. That means you’ll need to close slightly less than $2.8 million worth of real estate sales. (The breakdown: $75,000 of total commissions income ÷ 90% to account for the split ÷ 3% if that’s the transaction commission rate.) If the median sale price of a home in your area was $285,000, you’d need to close 10 deals a year to reach (and slightly exceed) your commission goal.</p>
<p>(If you want the quickest, easiest way to find out how many leads you’ll need to reach your annual income goal, use Market Leader’s free <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/leadcalculator/">Lead Calculator</a>. Simply punch in the numbers you’re aiming for, and the calculator will tell you how many transactions and leads you’ll need across all lead sources.)</p>
<p>Also, this is where investing in your <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/solutions/crm/">CRM</a> pays off. Analyze the data it provides to determine how many contacts it took you to generate the deals you closed last year.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">5. Call at the “Right Time”</h3>
<p>If you still don’t feel all warm and fuzzy about real estate cold calling, consider getting it out of the way as soon as possible so you can avoid procrastinating. Many agents like to make telephone prospecting the first thing they do every morning so they can get it off their mind and their to-do list.</p>
<p>Is that the best time to call? It could be. But as long as you comply with the FCC’s limitations, of course, any time may be a good time for you and your prospects.</p>
<p>You could go the route of following the statistics. For example, findings from <a href="https://www.revenue.io/blog/the-best-time-to-cold-call-prospects-in-2020">one recent study</a> suggested that “decision makers are more likely to engage in the late afternoon,” with engagement rates peaking “during the 4-5 p.m. hour.” And data from <a href="https://www.execvision.io/blog/best-time-cold-call/">another study</a> showed that “the best time to cold call a prospect is between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., with 10 a.m. (15.53%) and 2 p.m. (15.01%) providing the best response times.”</p>
<p>Studies like those might provide a good starting point. But ultimately, you need to find what works best for you and your prospects. That’s going to require some trial and error.</p>
<p>Hypothesize about what might work best, give it a try, track your results, and repeat the process until you’ve found a time range that yields the highest results. Once you’ve identified the ideal times to call, make that a regular part of your schedule and stick to it.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">6. Demonstrate Your Value Immediately</h3>
<p>The prospect should immediately learn 1) who you are and 2) what you bring to the table. And they should know both of those things <em>before</em> they can even begin to consider objections.</p>
<p>Sharing who you are is easy – just start off the call by mentioning your name and, if applicable, the name of your business or brokerage. But how can you demonstrate your value?</p>
<ul class="BlogUL">
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Share a version of your unique value proposition</strong>, a statement that expresses how you’re different (and better!) than your competitors. (Don’t have one? <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/real-estate-marketing-plan/">Market Leader’s free real estate marketing plan</a> walks you through the process of creating a unique value proposition, vision statement, and mission statement.)</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Share your enthusiasm.</strong> Think of Theodore Roosevelt’s famous line: “Nobody cares how much you know until they know how much you care.” Demonstrating your level of expertise is very important (which is why it’s our next point), but it’s not the only thing that matters when cold calling – you also need to show that you have their best interest at heart. Your prospect is looking for an advocate and cheerleader, not just a consultant.</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Share what you know.</strong> By translating not only facts and figures but also your interpretation, insights, and conclusions based on the data, you’re essentially saying, “I’m the local expert, I’ve put in the hard work to understand this market at a granular level, and I’m bringing a kind of value that no other agent can provide.” It’s that kind of analysis that will put you leagues beyond what your prospects can find on Zillow.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="BlogH3">7. Be Memorable</h3>
<p>Not only are you competing with other agents, you’re also competing with all of the other things that take prospects’ time and attention away from buying or selling. So find your own unique way to stand out. Maybe for you it’s your personality, a catchphrase, a resource you provide, or a personal connection you share.</p>
<p>But remember: Ultimately, the call isn’t about you. It’s about helping the prospect. So as you’re capturing their attention, be careful not to push them aside. Always help your prospects draw a clear connection between what you do and how (exactly) that benefits them.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">8. Give Them the Next Steps</h3>
<p>After the call is over, they should know what’s going to happen next. End by scheduling a meeting, for example, or nailing down the best time for a follow-up call.</p>
<p>Is there a specific action you want them to take after the call? Tell them plainly. Depending on the situation, you might have one specific call to action (e.g., “Take a look at the listings on my website,” or “Check out this <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/what-is-a-cma-in-real-estate/">CMA</a> and let me know what you think”).</p>
<p>Or maybe the next step is something you will do (e.g., “I’m going to shoot you an email that walks you through the buying process…,” or “I’ll give you a call on Wednesday…”).</p>
<p>In any case, don’t end the call without providing clarity about who is doing what when.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are two ways to approach this.</p>
<p>You could create a real estate business plan to avoid failure. Many agents go that route and find some level of success. There’s nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p>But there’s another way. You could create a business plan, not just because it reduces the risk of failure, but because it maximizes your growth potential.</p>
<p>What follows is an invitation to do just that – to go through the process of refining intentionality, elevating accountability, and igniting motivation so you can be more productive. Year after year.</p>
<p>What if 2023 was the year you generated more leads and closed more deals than ever before? It’s possible. But only if you have a plan to follow.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">The Real Estate Business Plan Checklist</h2>
<p>To provide the big-picture view, here are the action items you’ll need to include in your plan for this year:</p>
<ul class="BlogUL">
<li class="BlogLI">Note learnings from 2022</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Calculate your expenses</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Set goals</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Create a marketing plan</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Develop a system for tracking your progress</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re going to take a close look at each. But if you want to hop on the fast track, download the <a href="#download">2023 Real Estate Business Plan</a> and you can get started right away. This free, interactive guide from Market Leader covers everything on that checklist and more. Plus, you’ll get downloadable templates for calculating expenses, setting goals, planning your marketing, and tracking progress.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">5 Year-End Reflection Questions To Consider</h2>
<p>Sometimes you have to look back before you can move forward. Use the questions below as a way to reflect on last year’s performance so you can identify your business’s strengths, weaknesses, and potential.</p>
<ol class="BlogOL">
<li class="BlogLI">Which aspects of my real estate business <strong>occupied most of my time and attention</strong> last year?</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Which aspects of my business <strong>performed best</strong> last year? (For example, maybe you received many referrals, responded quickly to leads, or executed a strong social media campaign.)</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Based on last year’s performance, which aspects of my business <strong>are most in need of improvement</strong>?</li>
<li class="BlogLI">What are the <strong>top two or three mistakes</strong> I made last year that I need to learn from for 2023?</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>What would “success” look like</strong> specifically for my business in 2023?</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Calculate Your Expenses</h2>
<p>Believe it or not, tracking your expenses is an important prerequisite to maximizing your gross commission income for 2023. If you have the right expense-tracking system in place, you’ll get more of your hard-earned income back at the end of the year.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to track all of your deductible business expenses. You may be surprised to learn about the <a href="https://outfront.kw.com/training/11-tax-deductions-every-real-estate-agent-should-know-about/">many ways you can reduce the amount you owe to the IRS</a>. For example, you might even be eligible to deduct expenses related to software, marketing, advertising, and lead generation. Refer to <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p535.pdf">IRS Publication 535</a> for details and be sure to consult with your CPA or financial advisor so you don’t miss out on any money-saving tips.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Two of the Best Ways to Track Your Expenses</h3>
<ul class="BlogUL">
<li class="BlogLI">Use an app. There are many free and low-cost options that allow you to categorize and track your expenses on the go. For example, check out <a href="https://www.spendee.com/">Spendee</a> or <a href="https://dollarbird.co/">Dollarbird</a>. They’re both simple and user-friendly, and they both have options to get you started for less than $5 per month.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Download the free “Expense Tracker” template in Market Leader’s <a href="#download">2023 Real Estate Business Plan</a>. It provides space for you to calculate your personal living expenses and all of your various business expenses all in one place.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Set Your Real Estate Business Goals</h2>
<p>Start by <strong>identifying your average commission per transaction</strong>. Multiply the <a href="https://www.realtor.com/research/market-trends/">median listing price in your area</a> by your commission percentage rate.</p>
<p>Once you’ve calculated your expenses and you’ve figured out roughly how much you’ll bring in from each transaction, you’ll be informed enough to establish an <strong>attainable income goal for 2023</strong>.</p>
<p>From there you can determine how many transactions you’ll need for the year.</p>
<p>The Formula: A ÷ B = C</p>
<p>A. Your 2023 Income Goal<br />
B. Estimated Commission Per Transaction<br />
C. Transactions Needed for the Year</p>
<p>To drill down even farther, check out Market Leader’s free <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/leadcalculator/">Lead Calculator</a>. Simply punch in the numbers you’re aiming for, and the calculator will tell you how many transactions and leads you’ll need across all lead sources to reach your income goal.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Create a Marketing Plan</h2>
<p>Maybe you’re on your way to “top-performer” status, but you don’t have a great plan for getting more clients and increasing your gross commission income. Or maybe you have a plan, but it’s not working.</p>
<p>Either way, you’ll benefit from learning how to <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/real-estate-marketing-plan/">craft a well-developed real estate marketing plan</a> that’s specifically designed to help you <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/products/real-estate-leads/">generate more leads</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick outline sketch of what that would look like in practical terms.</p>
<ul class="BlogUL">
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Build your brand.</strong> Establish a brand identity that includes a mission statement, vision statement, and a value proposition.</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Define your target market.</strong> You can’t be everything to everyone. If you try, your brand will end up blending in instead of standing out. So take the time to identify who fits within your audience.</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Collect data.</strong> When you’re armed with statistics, analytics, and insights, you’re better able to set goals, track progress, and make your success repeatable. Without data, your marketing efforts are more likely to be a complete gamble, if not a guessing game.</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Get marketing automation tools.</strong> With <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/products/professional-for-agents/">Market Leader Professional</a>, for example, you get a customizable, lead-generating website and a fully integrated CRM. Plus, you can automate new listing alerts and even create newsletters and content pieces like postcards, flyers, and video-enabled mobile-responsive emails.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Track Your Progress</h2>
<p>Why is performance-tracking necessary?</p>
<ul class="BlogUL">
<li class="BlogLI">It’s a way of <strong>holding yourself accountable</strong> to the goals you set.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">It provides you with the <strong>feedback</strong> you need to make strategic adjustments.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">It enables you to create <strong>new benchmarks</strong> for future goals.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">It takes the guesswork out of your <strong>professional self-reflection</strong>.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">It’s the most efficient way to <strong>spot what’s working well and what needs improvement</strong>.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">It helps you <strong>prioritize</strong> and keeps you focused on what matters most.</li>
</ul>
<p>It doesn’t have to be time-consuming and complicated. It can be as easy as creating a basic table in your favorite word processor or spreadsheet software, writing down all of your goals in the left column, and using the rest of the columns to note your performance each month (or week).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is a CMA in real estate?</strong></p>
<p>“CMA” stands for comparative market analysis, and it refers to the process of estimating a property’s value, based on the listing prices and sold prices of similar homes nearby and other data related to the local market.</p>
<p>Many agents either don’t know how to do a CMA (because they didn’t receive any training) or they don’t realize its importance. So it ends up being just another task on their long list of obligations.</p>
<p>But it can be (should be!) much more than that. This kind of analysis is extremely valuable, especially in today’s fast-moving, ever-changing real estate market. It’s one of the most important things separating real estate agents from Zillow.</p>
<p>Get ready to learn everything you need to know about performing comparative market analyses that benefit leads, clients, and agents alike, because this article walks you through how to do a CMA in four simple steps.</p>
<p>But before we get into the nitty gritty, let’s take a step back to consider the purpose. Why is a CMA in real estate even necessary?</p>
<p>Knowing how to create a CMA from start to finish is important. But having a clear understanding of the “why” is what will give you a significant boost over your competitors.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">How a CMA Benefits <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Consumers</span></h2>
<p>The benefit of a CMA for sellers (or potential sellers) is obvious. By comparing their home to similar homes that either just sold or are under contract, <strong>they can get a better idea of what their home is currently worth</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>But a CMA can also be a valuable point of reference for <em>buyers</em>.</strong> They don’t want to make an offer that’s too low, and they don’t want to overpay. A CMA helps them avoid both risks. It helps them size up their competition (by showing them what other buyers may be willing to pay for the home they’re interested in) while also giving them a clear boundary that shows how high is too high.</p>
<p>In any case, what consumers of all kinds are looking for is objectivity. They want to know without a doubt that a home’s value is derived from a valid, data-driven process. Why? Because it <strong>provides a sense of comfort</strong> during what is often a stressful time and it <strong>gives them confidence</strong> to make a move (pun intended).</p>
<p>The upcoming four-step process for creating a CMA in real estate will offer all of the aforementioned consumer-facing benefits.</p>
<p>But a CMA also benefits you as the agent. Here’s how.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">How a CMA Benefits <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Real Estate Agents</span></h2>
<p>Let’s start with the basics.</p>
<p><strong>A CMA is a great way to prove your value and establish credibility.</strong> By showing not only facts and figures but also your interpretation, insights, and conclusions based on the data, you’re essentially saying, “I’m the local expert, I’ve put in the hard work to understand this market at a granular level, and I’m bringing a kind of value that no other agent can provide.”</p>
<p><strong>A CMA gives you the confidence you need to negotiate like a top-producer.</strong> You can rest on the power of objectivity instead of the weakness of personal opinion. It’s difficult to dismiss an offer or counter a price that’s supported with good data.</p>
<p>But did you know that a CMA can also be a powerful marketing tool?</p>
<p><strong>For example, consider sending prospects a CMA as part of your <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/real-estate-direct-mail/">direct mail marketing</a> strategy.</strong> Homeowners are rarely in touch with local market trends, despite what they might think. Few could tell you the current value of their home, and chances are, they’d be shocked to know how much the homes in their neighborhoods are currently selling for.</p>
<p>Leveraging a real estate CMA (even a lightweight CMA in a postcard, brochure-style pamphlet, or an email) can help prospects think more seriously about taking the next step. It could be that simply presenting that kind of information to a prospect – at a time when no other agent would – is all it takes to turn them into a lead, and eventually into a client.</p>
<p>By the way, <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/products/professional-for-agents/">you can easily create useful mini CMAs for your leads and clients with Market Leader Pro</a>.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">How To Do a CMA (for Sellers)</h2>
<p>First, a caveat. There’s no such thing as a one-size-fits-all process for making a CMA in real estate. The exact procedures will differ each time, depending on where you are, who it’s for, and why you’re doing it.</p>
<p>So while the four-step process outlined below is a kind of “how-to guide,” it can’t possibly take every situation into account. Too many factors and variables are involved, because all prospects, leads, clients, neighborhoods, homes, and listings are different.</p>
<p>For example, how you do a CMA for a standard ranch-style home in rural America is going to look very different than what you’d do for a inner-city luxury property in Toronto. And the process you’d go through to create a generalized direct mail piece will look different than it would if you were putting a report together for a buyer.</p>
<p>Regardless, it’s helpful to familiarize yourself with the basic methodology that this step-by-step guide outlines so you can tailor it to the needs at hand.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">The Checklist</h3>
<p>Every standard CMA in real estate (for a seller) will include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Property details (Step 1)</li>
<li>Comps (Step 2)</li>
<li>Pricing recommendations (Step 3)</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Step 1: Learn About the Home</h3>
<p>In the steps that follow, you’re going to find comparable listings (or “comps”). To do that, you first need to learn everything you can about the home so you’ll know how to draw accurate comparisons.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that you’re doing more than just fact-collecting. You’re also learning about the home’s “story,” so to speak: the history of the home, the neighborhood, and the surrounding area.</p>
<p>The more research you do here, the more accurate the CMA will be. But here are the essential pieces of information you’ll need to collect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Location</li>
<li>Size (square footage)</li>
<li>Year built</li>
<li>Number of beds and baths</li>
<li>Condition (e.g., Is it new-build? Have there been any significant renovations?)</li>
<li>Amenities, customizations, and special features</li>
<li>Property tax information</li>
</ul>
<p>You can draw from many different sources as you conduct your research, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The homeowner, of course</li>
<li>MLS data</li>
<li>Previous listing data (i.e., list price, sold price, days on the market, etc.)</li>
<li>The NAR’s <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/realtors-property-resource-rpr">Realtors Property Resource</a> (RPR)</li>
<li>Tax records</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Step 2: Compile a List of Comps</h3>
<p>Now that you know about the home, you know how to compare it to other homes in the area. Here are some best practices.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be smart about how you choose your comps.</strong> Comparables (i.e., “comps”) are listings (both sold and active) that are very similar to the property you’re working with. Get as close as you can to finding identical matches, especially in terms of their location, square footage, lot size, layout, style, and condition.</li>
<li><strong>Compile a strong list.</strong> Include enough properties on your list to determine an average and suggest a reasonable range of prices. But don’t make it so long that you and your client get bogged down with too much information.</li>
<li><strong>Stick with the here-and-now.</strong> Remember, the key to making a successful CMA in real estate is to work with accurate, reliable, and relevant data. There’s no point in comparing the home in question to a listing that sold three years ago, or even one year ago, for that matter. You and your client need to know what similar homes are selling for now. So stay current, within, say, the past three months. And in this market, you definitely shouldn’t dig back farther than six months.</li>
<li><strong>Look at sold prices and active listings.</strong> By looking at homes that have sold recently and listings that are currently active, you’ll get an even keener sense of the local market’s condition. Be sure to pay close attention to comparable listings that are currently under contract because that will give you insight into the difference between asking price and sold price. It’s those kinds of nuances that will both impress your clients and give you the competitive edge you need to become the local expert.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Step 3: Set Your Pricing Recommendations</h3>
<p>At this point you’ll be equipped with all of the information you need to provide sound guidance for your clients.</p>
<p>Give them a range of three numbers to consider – one that’s on the conservative side, one that’s on the aggressive side, and one that’s in the middle.</p>
<p>Base your pricing recommendations on three factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your list of comps</li>
<li>The home’s condition and appeal (including any adjustments that need to be made to account for customizations, amenities, renovations, etc.)</li>
<li>Anticipation of where the market seems to be headed</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Step 4: Create and Deliver Your CMA</h3>
<p>There are many formatting options and ways you could present your CMA report to your clients. For you, that might look like a PowerPoint presentation, a simple set of tables and charts, or even a quick email with a bulleted outline.</p>
<p>There’s no right or wrong here. But as we saw in the checklist above, be sure to include at least a summary of the property details, your list of comps, and your pricing recommendations. Make it easy for them to understand your process and how you arrived at your conclusions. Not only does this show the objectivity of your report, but it also puts your leads and clients at ease in case they’re disappointed by numbers they didn’t expect.</p>
<p>However you go about delivering and presenting your CMA, keep in mind that you’re bringing value, proving your worth, and demonstrating your expertise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pictures can say a thousand words, but they can’t say everything. At some point, the power of language has to take over.</p>
<p><strong>The best real estate listing description examples you can find will all have one thing in common: they’ll all have compelling marketing copy that was crafted to <em>sell</em>, not just describe.</strong></p>
<p>If you’ve been overlooking the sales power of copy in your listing descriptions, welcome. You’re not the only one. Mediocre (if not flat out poor) descriptions are the norm. And that’s unfortunate. Because listing descriptions are extremely important.</p>
<p>Consumers are now more likely to search online for a home than ever before. According to a recent report from <a href="https://cdn.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/2022-home-buyers-and-sellers-generational-trends-03-23-2022.pdf">NAR</a>, “Among all generations of home buyers, the first step taken in the home search process was to look online for properties.”</p>
<p>Half of all buyers they surveyed (51%) said they found the home they purchased online. (Which is almost double the amount of those who said they found their home through their agent, by the way.)</p>
<p><strong>The point is, real estate listing descriptions matter. They may even matter a lot, especially if they’re done well.</strong></p>
<p>And the best part is, it’s not as if you have to spend a ton of time mastering the art and science of copywriting. All it takes to boost the selling power of your listing descriptions is a bit of know-how and some practice.</p>
<p>This article will walk you through exactly how to write descriptions that sell (and how not to write them). Then we’ll take a look at four real estate listing description examples from top-notch agents so you can see how it’s done.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">How To Write a Real Estate Listing Description</h2>
<p>Here are some best practices to keep in mind as you supercharge your listings with compelling marketing copy.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Start With the Seller</h3>
<p>As the agent, you can put pieces together and come up with some ideas about what you should highlight in the description. But the seller has a unique perspective on the home, and they know better than you do what it’s like to live there day to day. They’ll almost certainly raise excellent selling points that never would have occurred to you unless you had asked.</p>
<p>Find out what it was that originally caught their attention when they bought. What do they love about it? What will they miss when they sell?</p>
<p>Their favorite things about the home are likely to be the same things that will attract potential buyers. So before you work your marketing magic, get inspiration straight from the sellers themselves.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Write to Your Audience</h3>
<p>In other words, don’t write listing descriptions that only sound good to you and your client. Let it all revolve around potential buyers (and their agent).</p>
<p>Listing agents are, above all else, marketers. And marketers always determine a target buyer for their products before coming up with a plan.</p>
<p>We don’t see urban streetwear companies appealing to Gen X or Baby Boomers. Millennials aren’t likely to get targeted online ads from AARP. Yet the average listing description is a lot like the average real estate agent – trying to be all things to all people. That has never worked before, and it won’t work for you.</p>
<p>So before you write a word, put yourself in your prospects’ shoes. What will they want to hear? What are the kinds of things they’ll be looking for? Write their dream home into your copy.</p>
<p>What objections or fears might they have? Cut them off at the pass and address concerns head-on. Do they think it’s unaffordable? Talk about how easy financing can be.</p>
<p>Is it a family home with a large backyard and schools nearby? Speak directly to the parents. Is it a swanky uptown condo that looks like a status symbol? Speak to that millionaire entrepreneur looking for a home that doubles as an accessory.</p>
<p>Your listing descriptions need a personal flair that cater to the home buyers you’re trying to reach. Play into their vision, and make it clear that your listing is exactly what they’re looking for.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Craft a Killer Headline</h3>
<p>The amazing listing description you labored to create is worthless if no one reads it. And the best way to get potential buyers to read your description is to write a headline they can’t ignore, a headline that captures their attention and sets the tone for the entire listing.</p>
<p>The main purpose of the headline is to get them to read the first line of your description. And the main purpose of that first line is to get them to read your second line, and on and on it goes.</p>
<p>If you spent as much time crafting the headline as you did writing the description, it would be time well spent.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Think Like a Copywriter</h3>
<p>When you’re writing real estate listing descriptions, you’re writing to sell. At its core, what you’re doing here is no different than what legendary advertising experts like <a href="https://www.oneclub.org/hall-of-fame/-bio/david-ogilvy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">David Ogilvy</a> did for decades.</p>
<p>So don’t approach this task as a real estate agent filling in the blank on a form that says “Description”. Approach it as if you were Mad Men’s Don Draper penning irresistible marketing copy that turns heads and closes deals.</p>
<p>To make your “adman” impersonation believable, here are some quick-and-dirty tips for writing like a copywriter.</p>
<ul class="BlogUL">
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Lead with the benefits.</strong> Then move to the features. In other words, talk first about how the home will benefit the buyer, what problems it may solve for them, and why all of that matters. Then get into the specs and nitty-gritty details.</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Write like a human.</strong> Studies have proven over and over that simple, person-to-person writing is most effective. So say what you mean and keep it conversational. Read it out loud to test yourself – if it sounds like normal human speech, you’re on the right track!</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Be concise.</strong> Less is (often) more when it comes to writing marketing copy. Use powerful words that pack a punch instead of frivolous adverbs.</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Create a sense of urgency.</strong> Buyers know homes don’t stay on the market for long. Give them that extra nudge they need to take action now by <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/create-sense-of-urgency-in-prospect-roleplay">creating a sense of urgency</a>.</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>“Show, don’t tell.”</strong> Guide their daydreaming and create mental images. Why list the dimensions of the kitchen when you could say, “You can cook for 2 or 20 in this spacious, guest-friendly kitchen.” Instead of stating flatly that the ceilings are made of plaster, mention that they could “entertain beneath soaring Venetian plaster ceilings.”</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Don’t Do This When You Write Listing Descriptions</h2>
<p>Now you know how to write real estate listing descriptions. But here’s what not to do.</p>
<ul class="BlogUL">
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Don’t overthink it.</strong> Yes, your listing descriptions are important. But the stakes aren’t so high that you need to spend hours and hours crafting a perfect piece. Why? First, because it’ll take you way too long to write. And also because your writing will show that you overthought it, which will make it less effective.</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Don’t use clever or flowery language.</strong> Write plainly. This isn’t a novel. The words themselves shouldn’t steal the spotlight. Yes, think creatively, but don’t distract the prospect with pretty prose. It’s counterproductive and misses the point completely.</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Don’t repeat information.</strong> Space is valuable. Don’t waste it by repeating all of the details that show up in the listing details. Describe the property in a way that doesn’t tell them what they already know (e.g., lot size, year built, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>There are more blunders to avoid. <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/5-cringe-worthy-mistakes-experienced-agents-make-on-their-listings/">Learn about the five cringe-worthy mistakes experienced agents make on their listings.</a></p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">4 Creative Real Estate Listing Description Examples</h2>
<p>Glean wisdom from these four noteworthy listing description examples from expert real estate agents and let the inspiration begin.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">1. Evoke Settings &amp; Scenes</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-61763 " src="https://www.marketleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Cathedral.png" alt="Real estate listing description example #1" width="443" height="760" /></p>
<p>This first listing description example does a great job of using language to create mental images. For example, we imagine waking up in the loft suite, hosting a big party out on the deck, and huddling around the fire pit. Framing your listing descriptions in this way gets your prospects to “read between the lines” and see in their mind’s eye more than what appears in the copy. (Plus, this listing gets extra credit for ending with that perfect call to action!)</p>
<p>Well done, <a href="https://www.eastsidepropertysearch.com/listing/mlsid/185/propertyid/1997697/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aubie Pouncey</a>!</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">2. Pile Up All the Perks</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-61764" src="https://www.marketleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lynnwood.png" alt="Real estate listing description example #2" width="443" height="763" /></p>
<p>Notice how this listing description example heaps on the goodness. Just when you think it couldn’t get any better, it does. We learn immediately that it’s “better than new” in that fantastic opening line. As we read on, we hear about upgrade after upgrade, with the excitement-building repetition of the word “new”. By the end, it sets the prospect up to feel like the decision to make a move on this house is a no-brainer. Numerous renovations, great floor plan, “dramatic two story entry,” private yard, fantastic location… What more could you want!?</p>
<p>Thanks for showing us how it’s done, <a href="https://www.elizabethavery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elizabeth Avery</a>!</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">3. Show Authentic Enthusiasm</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-61765" src="https://www.marketleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bramble.png" alt="Real estate listing description example #3" width="443" height="761" /></p>
<p>The excitement is palpable. And yet, it doesn’t come across as contrived or cheesy. This home’s apparent uniqueness speaks for itself, and the copy in this third listing description example does a great job of emphasizing that fact. It leaves the reader feeling as if they just have to see it to believe it. It’s hard not to feel joyful when you read things like, “this home is nothing short of AMAZING,” and, “This location is one you just can’t recreate!” And as a side note, who doesn’t want to work with an agent with that kind of contagious energy!?</p>
<p>We can feel your beachside happiness all the way from here, <a href="https://www.peggyrowerealty.com/listing/mlsid/297/propertyid/900674/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peggy Rowe</a>!</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">4. Speak to the Heart of Your Audience With Laser-like Focus</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-61766 aligncenter" src="https://www.marketleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Scottsdale.png" alt="Real estate listing descriptions example #4" width="443" height="735" /></p>
<p>This final home listing description example demonstrates why it’s so important to understand your audience. If you have a thorough understanding of who your potential buyers are, what they care about, and what their pain points are, you’ll know exactly how to capture their hearts with your listing description. This example has a very clear target (buyers interested in downsizing; buyers who have prioritized convenience and simplicity; buyers looking for a vacation home, seasonal home, or a home they can feel comfortable leaving behind when they travel). And the entire listing description is centered on meeting their needs and addressing their concerns.</p>
<p>Thank you, <a href="https://www.pollyblackwell.com/listing/mlsid/8/propertyid/6477055/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polly Blackwell</a>! You nailed it.</p>

<p>Still not sure if you’re ready to take the first step? That’s okay. To give you an idea of what to expect, here’s a sketch of some of the concepts covered in the full guide.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">What Is a Real Estate Marketing Plan?</h2>
<p>A real estate marketing plan is an organized collection of strategies, systems, and schedules that individual agents, teams, and brokerages use to guide their marketing efforts.</p>
<p>Every marketing plan for real estate must incorporate the five essential components listed below.</p>
<p>Which (if any) do you already have in place?</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">A Brand Structure</h3>
<p>If you have a weak brand, you’re more likely to lose focus, disappear in the crowd of competition, and misrepresent who you are as an agent. All of which reduces productivity and hinders your ability to acquire and retain quality leads.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH3">Data &amp; Analytics</h2>
<p>When you’re armed with statistics, analytics, and insights, you’re better able to set goals, track progress, and make your success repeatable. Without data, your marketing efforts are more likely to be a complete gamble, if not a guessing game.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">An Understanding of Consumers’ New Expectations</h3>
<p>Service providers of all kinds are constantly adjusting the way they do business to keep up with changes in technology, tactics, and trends. Are you aware of what prospects and clients expect of you as a real estate agent? If not, you risk falling to the background.</p>
<p>For example, most of today’s consumers expect prompt communication via text message. In a <a href="https://cdn.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/2022-home-buyers-and-sellers-generational-trends-03-23-2022.pdf">2022 report from the National Association of Realtors</a> (NAR), 71% of buyers said it was “important” to receive property information and communication from their agent via text message. Whereas in <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/reports/2015/2015-home-buyer-and-seller-generational-trends-2015-03-11.pdf">2015</a> – just seven years earlier – that figure was only 45%.</p>
<p>Consumers expectations change fast, and you need to keep up.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Social Proof</h3>
<p>Speaking of what consumers want, near the top of the list is authentic proof of your competency, especially in the form of reviews and testimonials. In what ways could you add social proof to your marketing efforts? Common ways for agents include requesting reviews on their Facebook pages or Zillow profiles.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Technology &amp; Tools</h3>
<p>The best real estate marketing plans include a social media strategy, video content, <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/solutions/marketing-automation/">robust marketing automation tools</a>, a <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/solutions/customizable-websites/">customizable real estate website</a>, and a <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/solutions/crm/">fully-integrated CRM</a>. But of course, merely having the right tools won’t be enough. You have to know how to use them.</p>
<p>Learn how. <a style="font-weight: 800;" href="#download">Download our free “2023 Real Estate Marketing Plan”</a> and make today the day you begin taking your business to the next level.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Only SMART Goals Will Produce the Results You Want</h2>
<p>Goal-setting is a crucial part of marketing for real estate agents. And maybe you’ve already established goals, but you’re not seeing the results you want.</p>
<p>The reason may be that they’re not SMART goals: smart, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound.</p>
<p>This approach enables you to set realistic goals while also increasing the likelihood that you’ll actually achieve them.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">3 Examples of SMART Goals</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>“I will increase the average number of leads I generate every month by 20 percent by the end of 2023.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I will attend one webinar or download one guide about lead generation best practices every month throughout 2023.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I will 1) research which real estate website provider has the best websites for generating leads and 2) implement a new website from that provider by the end of the first quarter.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Want a full breakdown of each part of the acronym so you can start setting results-producing goals today? <a style="font-weight: 800;" href="#download">Get our free interactive marketing planning guide.</a></p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">5 Must-Have Real Estate Marketing Strategies</h2>
<p>Goals are worthless if you don’t have specific strategies in place to help you reach them. Think of them as the difference between planning and wishful thinking. They are the “how” to your “what.”</p>
<p>It would be impossible to list <em>all</em> of the many strategies you could implement as part of your marketing plan. Plus, it wouldn’t be very helpful for you to skim through a dizzying array of possibilities. Instead, let’s narrow it down to five real estate marketing ideas that are sure to generate more leads.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Invest in Advertising</h3>
<p>In the <a style="font-weight: 800;" href="#download">“2023 Real Estate Marketing Plan,”</a> not only will you get practical pro tips for advertising, but you’ll also get a customizable budgeting calendar so you can put money where your <em>month</em> is.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Develop a Strategy for Referrals</h3>
<p>Imagine if every one of your former clients referred someone to you every year. That’s totally conceivable, and the success would be compounding – and life-changing! The guide gives you three ideas to jumpstart your referral strategy brainstorming session.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Use Marketing Automation Tools</h3>
<p>The best marketing automation tools do it all. With <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/products/professional-for-agents/">Market Leader Professional</a>, for example, you get a customizable, lead-generating website; a fully-integrated CRM; and the ability to automate new listing alerts, newsletters, and print and digital content pieces like postcards, flyers, and video-enabled mobile-responsive emails.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Leverage the Power of Social Media</h3>
<p>To give you a shortcut for implementing an efficient and productive social media strategy, the <a style="font-weight: 800;" href="#download">“2023 Real Estate Marketing Plan”</a> provides a handy “Social Media Cheat Sheet” so you’ll know the audience, tone, and user intentions applicable for each channel.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Get Exclusive Buyer &amp; Seller Leads Delivered to You Each Month</h3>
<p>Securing a steady stream of exclusive online leads each month cuts down on the time you have to spend on prospecting, while also putting you in a better position to plan for the future. For example, Market Leader offers <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/products/real-estate-leads/">real estate leads</a> which will empower you to reach your sales goals and sidestep the stressful boom-and-bust cycle.</p>
<h2 id="download" class="BlogH2">What Else Is Included in the Guide?</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To put the bottom line at the top, referral commission for real estate agents is approximately 25% of the gross commission from the applicable side of the transaction.</p>
<p>Why “approximately”? Because there isn’t a standard rate for referral fees (and therefore referral commissions), and they’re negotiable.</p>
<p>You likely have many more questions related to referral fees in real estate. If so, you’re not alone. It can be a complicated topic.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at some of the most frequently asked questions about agent-to-agent referrals.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Why Would I Ever Send Business to Someone Else?</h2>
<p>It’s a fair question. If nothing else, the concept of giving a referral might seem somewhat counterproductive at first. But there are certainly times when a referral is the best option. Here are the most common reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The obvious one first: <strong>You can get a significant portion of the paycheck for doing a small portion of the work</strong>. Of course, you’d probably rather do all of the work and cash in on all of the commission. But there are a few reasons why that may not be possible, which would mean collecting a referral fee is your best option. Here are two examples…</li>
<li><strong>It’s an out-of-market transaction.</strong> Let’s say, for example, a client of yours is looking to buy a home in another state, a state in which you aren’t licensed. You can’t be the one to complete the sale, but you can refer your client to another agent and receive a referral commission on that transaction. Many businesses, like <a href="https://www.referralexchange.com/">ReferralExchange.com</a>, can help you find out-of-state agents to make referrals to.</li>
<li><strong>You’re not qualified to help.</strong> It’s good to have a wide range of expertise. But not every real estate agent is qualified to handle every type of transaction. Sometimes you’re just not a good fit for the job. For example, a residential real estate agent may not be able to work with commercial properties. Rather than stumbling beyond your purview, sometimes it’s best to hand it off to an agent who can provide the help your client needs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="BlogH2">What Is a Fair Real Estate Referral Commission?</h2>
<p>There are two pitfalls to avoid: asking too much and asking too little. If your referral fee is too high, you jeopardize the relationship you have with the other real estate agent. And that could come back to haunt you later when the tables are turned and they choose to refer business to someone else.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if your referral fee is too low, you might be forfeiting the portion of the commission that’s rightfully yours.</p>
<p>So where’s the middle ground?</p>
<p>A good rule of thumb is to stick close to the standard referral fee for real estate agents, which is about <a href="https://www.referralexchange.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ReferralExchange-Report_2017.pdf">25%</a>. Some agents go as high as 50% and some go as low as 20%.</p>
<p>Where you set the rate for your referral fee is completely up to you. As long as you avoid both pitfalls, keep your network happy, and stay open to negotiation, you’ll be on the right track.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Why Should I Seek To Get More Referrals From Agents?</h2>
<p>First, because referral commission in real estate can be lucrative.</p>
<p>How lucrative? It’s difficult to say. But using an example to break down some rough estimates will give you a good idea.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSPUS">current median home sale price</a> in the U.S. is reportedly around $440,300.</li>
<li>Let’s say the total commission (for one side of the transaction) is 5%. Using $440,300 as our example, that would amount to $22,015.</li>
<li>If the commission fee is 25% of $22,015, the referral agent would receive $5,503.75 (before taxes and fees, of course). Not bad for just a moment’s worth of work!</li>
</ul>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/blogs/economists-outlook/sources-of-income-for-real-estate-agents">a recent study from the National Association of Realtors</a> (NAR), the typical Realtor receives approximately one quarter of their income from real estate referral commission (both from consumers and other agents).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.referralexchange.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ReferralExchange-Report_2017.pdf">Another study</a> indicated that outbound referrals “make up a median of 12.5% of total transactions per agent per year.” And if the commission fees are around 25%, that can really add up to a significant amount of income for all agents involved.</p>
<p>Combining data points like these (<a href="https://listwithclever.com/real-estate-blog/realtor-referral-how-do-referral-agents-work-and-get-paid/">and others</a>), it’s not hard to see why agents often lean toward a favorable view of the income-generating power of referral commission.</p>
<p>And another reason to pursue more referrals is because one referral often leads to many more, which can eventually become <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/products/real-estate-leads/">a steady (and passive!) lead generation source</a>. If that piques your interest, be sure to learn <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/5-ways-to-build-a-referral-based-business/">these five ways to build a referral-based business</a>.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Is It Possible To Miss Out on Real Estate Referral Commission?</h2>
<p>Okay fine, this is not a frequently asked question. But maybe it should be. Because the answer is yes. There are two ways to mess up referrals.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Don’t Put It in Writing</h3>
<p>Real estate referral commission deals can get messy for all parties involved without a contract. Not only could it jeopardize the relationship you have with the client and the other agent and brokerage, but the transaction could even be illegal.</p>
<p>Whether you’re giving or receiving referral commission, be sure you have a real estate referral contract written up that documents everything about the transaction. Check out this <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/applications-and-forms/2013/REALTOR-REFERRAL-FORM-F-2013-11-18.pdf">referral contract</a> from the NAR, for example.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Ignore the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA)</h3>
<p>If you’re an agent working in the U.S., you’ll need to abide by the statutes outlined in the RESPA, a law Congress passed in 1974 to protect consumers. It ensures that consumers are always aware of the costs associated with their lone, and it helps to prevent costs from rising for unethical and unnecessary reasons.</p>
<p>Among other provisions, <a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_respa_frequently_asked_questions.pdf">RESPA</a> “prohibits certain actions related to federally related mortgage loans,” including kickbacks and “unearned fee arrangements.”</p>
<p>To summarize the legalese, it means no portion of any real estate referral fees involved in a transaction can make their way to a third party or any person or entity that isn’t a licensed agent. For example, agents can’t abuse the right to add the cost of referral fees to a consumer’s loan so they can pay off insurance companies, appraisers, construction companies, home inspectors, or attorneys for more business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Generating more listing leads can be extremely difficult. But it’s never impossible. Unless of course… you have a flawed plan. Or worse, no plan at all.</p>
<p>You may have heard the often-quoted (and apparently anonymous) adage that goes something like this:</p>
<p>“Every system is perfectly designed to give you the results you’re getting.”</p>
<p>We hear it often because it’s true. So if you’ve hit a point in your career where you&#8217;re only getting buyer leads, it may simply be a matter of refining your lead generation system and your plan for growth. We’re about to do just that.</p>
<p>To help you eliminate the guesswork involved in getting more listing leads, we’ve boiled it all down to seven essential tactics:</p>
<ol class="BlogOL">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol class="BlogOL">
<li class="BlogLI">Build Your Brand</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Nail Your Marketing</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Work Your Network</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Warm Up to Cold Calling</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Attend Events &amp; Host Your Own</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Find Your New Friends</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Buy Real Estate Leads</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s start with the foundation.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Build Your Brand</h2>
<p>Put simply, <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/real-estate-agents-need-a-brand/">your brand</a> is what other people think of you and your real estate business. You have many competitors in this field, and branding is your differentiator. Everything you do to attract clients should fit into a compelling and cohesive brand experience.</p>
<p>Want to <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/improve-your-branding-to-attract-better-clients/">improve your real estate branding</a> so you can generate more listing leads? Start by answering these three essential questions:</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">What Is Your Unique Value Proposition?</h3>
<p>A unique value proposition (UVP) is a statement that informs prospective clients about what sets you apart from the other agents in your market. Think of it as an elevator pitch, but in writing. It’s what shows you’re not a dime-a-dozen agent.</p>
<p>Your UVP should be concise. It should be punchy so that it’s as memorable and clear as possible. Most UVPs are only a sentence or two in length.</p>
<p>Use numbers whenever possible. Stats and figures give prospects something to hold on to. Plus, they go a long way in boosting perceived credibility.</p>
<p>Does your value proposition speak directly to sellers? For example:</p>
<p>“I have helped more clients sell their Seattle homes in the last five years than any other agent. My client’s homes sell in an average of just 20 days, 25 percent faster than the average for my area.”</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">What is Your Mission Statement</h3>
<p>Your mission statement takes your UVP and turns it into an action that’s tied to a greater purpose. It explains what you do, who you serve, how you’re different, and why you do what you do.</p>
<p>A well-crafted mission statement serves two very important functions. First, it keeps you focused on your priorities, your overarching purpose, and the meaningfulness of your work. And second, it tells your prospects and clients exactly what they can expect when they work with you.</p>
<p>A mission statement does not need to be comprehensive, overly specific and detailed, or even a complete sentence.</p>
<p>To get the creative juices flowing, consider these two examples:</p>
<p><a href="https://news.remax.com/our-mission-to-be-the-worldwide-real-estate-leader/">RE/MAX:</a> “To be the worldwide real estate leader, achieving our goals by helping others achieve theirs. Everybody wins.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/company">Atlassian:</a> “From medicine and space travel, to disaster response and pizza deliveries, our products help teams all over the planet advance humanity through the power of software. Our mission is to help unleash the potential of every team.”</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Who Is Your Target Market</h3>
<p>You can’t be everything to everyone. If you try, your brand will end up blending in instead of standing out. So take the time to identify a focused target audience.</p>
<p>Try to be as specific as possible. To narrow down even farther, consider creating profiles (or “<a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-research">personas</a>”) based on your top two or three ideal clients.</p>
<p>Let data be your guide. For example, if you’re interested in a particular neighborhood, get all of the information you can find about the demographics in that area. Learn about who follows you on social media. <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/solutions/customizable-websites/">Get a customizable website with MLS listings</a> which attracts buyers and sellers and – crucially – collects and analyzes data about visitors’ activities.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Nail Your Marketing</h2>
<p>Now that you’ve considered the essential brand identity questions for your business, you’re ready to move on to the second step: adjusting your marketing strategy to attract more listing leads.</p>
<p>Yes, you can buy <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/products/real-estate-leads/">online real estate leads</a>. But you also need to incorporate that lead generation strategy into a solid marketing plan that includes tried-and-true best practices as well as the newest cutting-edge ideas.</p>
<p>To provide the briefest of checklists, here are three marketing strategy must-haves.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">A Social Media Strategy Designed To Get More Listing Leads</h3>
<p>Don’t underestimate the power of having a strong digital presence through social media. It may be among the simplest and most effective ways to generate leads.</p>
<p>Of course, if you’re looking for more listing leads, be sure to post content that’s especially relevant for potential sellers in your area. Provide useful tips, helpful advice, and insightful statistics that demonstrate credibility and trustworthiness. With each impression, you’re increasing the likelihood that you’ll be top-of-mind when they’re ready to sell.</p>
<p>If you haven’t already, take 15 minutes to <a href="https://fitsmallbusiness.com/real-estate-facebook-page/">create a Facebook page for your business</a> that’s tailored specifically to accommodate potential home sellers. Always remember to keep your professional profiles public so they’re discoverable by the networks of people you are connected to.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Advertising Investment</h3>
<p>First, define which advertising channels you’ll use to promote your business. Then determine your budget for each channel. Sometimes it’s easiest to decide what you can afford on a monthly basis at first, and as you identify what performs best, you can map out your annual budget.</p>
<p>Ad placement is crucial. Rather than placing ads where all of the other listing agents are and hoping for the best, think specifically about the home sellers in your target market and where they spend their time – both online and in person. Do your research and allow the findings to help you determine the best place to advertise.</p>
<p>Important: In addition to the monetary cost of advertising dollars, think of the time cost involved with setting up and managing your campaigns. Should you be the one creating your seller lead generation campaigns, or an advertising expert who will be more effective and efficient?</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Marketing Automation Tools</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/real-estate-marketing-automation/">best real estate marketing automation tools</a> do it all. With <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/products/professional-for-agents/">Market Leader Professional</a>, for example, you get a customizable website, a fully-integrated CRM, and the ability to automate campaigns, newsletters, and content pieces like postcards, flyers, and video-enabled mobile-responsive emails which will help you stay top-of-mind with your contact database so they think of you when it’s time to sell.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Work Your Network</h2>
<p>If marketing is primarily about trying to reach prospects “out there,” networking is primarily about connecting with the many listing leads you’ll find “right here” in your social spheres. You’ve built your brand. You’ve developed a marketing strategy. And now it’s time to work your network.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Let Friends and Family Know You’re a Real Estate Agent</h3>
<p>It’s simple. It’s basic. And we mention it here because it’s an essential part of every lead generation strategy. Personal connection often trumps any other kind of connection.</p>
<p>And chances are, someone who is part of your family or friend group is currently thinking about selling their home. If not, they probably know someone who is. Make sure it’s your name that’s fresh on their mind.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Tap Into to the Wider Social Circle</h3>
<p>What organizations, teams, and communities are you a part of? What about friends of friends? Are you part of any groups on social media?</p>
<p>Most people belong to a bunch of networks without even realizing it. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Church groups</li>
<li>Clubs, like Rotary, rec sports teams, and alumni organizations</li>
<li>Online group like Nextdoor communities and neighborhood Facebook pages</li>
</ul>
<p>This wider social circle is full of high-quality prospects and excellent referral sources. All of whom are more likely to choose you over a stranger without a shared interest.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Warm Up to Cold Calling</h2>
<p>Some real estate agents dislike cold calling because it’s frustrating. Others feel anxious just reading about it. The truth is, it’s often both frustrating and frightening.</p>
<p>Some argue that it’s one of the most important ways to generate listing leads. Others argue that it’s a waste of time. Again – both are true.</p>
<p>Like it or not, cold calling is still an effective way to get more real estate seller leads. The key is to understand who to target and how to talk to them. Here are two groups to target as part of the fourth step in getting more listing leads.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Call FSBOs—“For Sale by Owner” Real Estate Listings)</h3>
<p>Even though they might be resistant to the idea at first, many DIY home sellers can be persuaded to work with you instead when they realize how much you can help.</p>
<p>Find FSBO listings on sites like Craigslist, ForSaleByOwner.com, and Zillow. Then give them a call, using <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/best-fsbo-scripts/">the best FSBO script you can find</a> to increase the persuasion factor.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Call Expired Listings</h3>
<p>A step-by-step guide for getting more listing leads would be incomplete if it didn’t include a tip about expired listings. These would-be-sellers are often in a tough spot.</p>
<p>They had hopes and dreams of selling but couldn’t. And now they’ve either given up or they’re unsure about how to move forward. You can be the agent who sweeps in to restore their confidence. Be sure to use <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/expired-listing-scripts/">the best expired listing scripts</a> for each situation.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Attend Events &amp; Host Your Own</h2>
<p>Top-performing listing agents are always connected to a wide network. They’re always on the lookout for new ways to develop relationships.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to do that is to attend in-person events and to host your own. Here are the top three ways to expand your reach so you can get more listing leads.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Attend Networking Events</h3>
<p>There are many different kinds of events that are meant to help you establish a stronger network. But if you want more seller clients, look for meetups, community events, and smaller conferences that will put you in contact specifically with sellers from your target market.</p>
<p>Struggling to find any events that are a good fit for you? Host your own!</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Host a Community Event</h3>
<p>Rather than going to meet prospects, have them come to you. It can be related to real estate, but it doesn’t have to be. Have fun and get creative with it.</p>
<p>Host a party, charity dinner, concert, local business giveaway event… the options are endless. It could be small or large, simple or extravagant.</p>
<p>As long as you’re reaching out to potential home sellers in your area and getting a chance to mingle, you’re on the right track.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Host Open Houses</h3>
<p>Another great way to attract home seller leads is to host open houses. Captivating ones, not boring ones.</p>
<p>Think of them as another kind of networking opportunity or community event. Make it the kind of event which potential listing leads in your area would actually want to attend, then show them what they can expect if they work with you to sell their home.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Find Your New Friends</h2>
<p>You could be the kind of lone-wolf real estate agent who shoulders everything on their own. There may be advantages to that. But it also comes at a great cost.</p>
<p>You need help from a circle of friends: go-to contractors, photographers, movers, video editors, and other professionals from real estate-related fields.</p>
<p>Working without them can prevent you from forming strong connections with your clients, building new relationships, generating listing leads, and managing your day-to-day tasks. And that might mean you have to turn away business because you simply can’t find enough hours in the day.</p>
<p>But you don’t have to go that route. Instead, consider forming a team around you of experts who can offer support where you need it most. Not only can they shoulder the weight by providing the expertise you need, but they can also expand your reach and multiply your marketing efforts. Here are two ways to find your new circle of friends.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Partner With Contractors, Home Stagers, Photographers, and Videographers</h3>
<p>The benefit of having a go-to network like this is twofold. It sets you up to provide help for your sellers when they need these kinds of services. And at the same time, it widens your network and increases the number of potential referral sources you have.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Start a Team of Listing Agents (Or Join One)</h3>
<p>Real estate agents are choosing to team up with other agents now more than ever before. There are four main reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>A team structure provides accountability.</strong> Members keep each other on track and motivate, celebrate, and encourage each other along the way. All of that goes far beyond the warm-and-fuzzies. It leads to greater levels of productivity.</li>
<li><strong>Teams often have a larger and more reliable stream of leads.</strong> They can combine their lead generation, marketing efforts, and social networks to create a business that’s greater than the sum of its parts.</li>
<li><strong>Working as a team presents an opportunity for each agent to specialize and focus on what he or she does best.</strong> The best teams work as a complementary whole – where one agent is weak, the other is strong, and vice versa.</li>
<li><strong>There are now more tools than ever before</strong> that make it possible for teams to work together and crush their gross commission income goals. With <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/products/pro-for-teams/">Market Leader’s Pro for Teams</a>, for example, real estate teams can recruit and retain agents, increase productivity with top-notch marketing automation, and create a seamless brand experience. All with one platform.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Buy Real Estate Leads</h2>
<p>In real estate, even the best business plans have to account for elements of unpredictability. There are always going to be factors that are out of your control. But getting a steady stream of exclusive online listing leads doesn’t have to be one of them.</p>
<p>Market Leader offers two real estate leads products to help you grow your business. One flat monthly rate buys you a guaranteed number of exclusive buyer and seller leads in your desired areas every month.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The best real estate agents don’t merely leave a message after the <em>beep</em>. They leave a <strong>benefit</strong>.</p>
<p>Chances are, your leads’ voicemail inboxes are overflowing with robocall time-wasters and spam from scammers. You need to differentiate yourself by providing a strong reason to call back in order to have any chance of getting a response.</p>
<p>That isn’t to say leaving a voicemail as a real estate agent is pointless. It’s still a highly-effective strategy. It’s just that standing out among the junk now requires a bit of technique and a dash of finesse. That’s where these scripts and best practices come in.</p>

<h2 class="BlogH2">Best Practices for Leaving Voicemails</h2>
<p>Anyone can leave a voicemail. But to nail it like an expert agent and consistently get a response from your leads, there are many techniques you have to follow every time you leave a message.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Prepare Like a Pro</h3>
<ul class="BlogUL">
<li class="BlogLI">Do your research. Calling a new or old lead can feel nerve-racking, but even just a little bit of preparation is all it takes to provide the confidence you need to succeed. Make sure you have all of the relevant details about your lead close at hand so you can be ready to bring your best, whether they pick up or not.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Get ready. The best way to avoid sputtering a scattered, rambling message is simply to stop and center yourself. Pause for a moment to ensure you’re in the right headspace to leave an outstanding message that’s bursting with significance. And do what you need to do to feel energized so that you can convey enthusiasm.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Clear your throat and prepare your voice so you don’t ruin a good script by performing it with that raspy, I-just-woke-up sound. How? Rattle off some <a href="https://www.voices.com/blog/vocal_warm_ups/">tricky tongue twisters</a> or run through some <a href="https://www.scienceofpeople.com/vocal-warm-ups/">vocal warmups.</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Leave an Unignorable Voicemail</h3>
<ul class="BlogUL">
<li class="BlogLI"><em>Always</em> leave a voicemail. Why? Two main reasons. First, your prospect or lead needs to connect you with your number so they can call you back or know it’s you when you try again. Most of us ignore calls from numbers we don’t know. And second, reaching the inbox presents a golden opportunity for you to introduce yourself and establish your brand and personality. Every point of contact—even one as small as a voicemail message—is a chance to plant a seed that one day may result in a commission check.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Follow a script. The goal isn’t to sound like a robot. A well-structured script is actually meant to do the opposite—it’s meant to help you sound like <em>you</em>. That’s why it’s important to adapt your scripts to match your brand voice. Memorize them. Record yourself or ask a friend to help you practice to ensure you sound natural while working through the script.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Be relational, not salesy. No one wants to feel like they’re being used to boost your bottom line. So be friendly and provide value. Demonstrate that you actually care about them as a person.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Sound confident, not desperate. This too is a turn-off for many prospects. Establish trust immediately and make sure they feel like you’re the service-oriented expert who can provide what they need.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Express enthusiasm. (Without overdoing it.) Your prospect will often reciprocate your tone. So avoid speaking with a monotone, drab, and lifeless voice. If you’re cheerful, excited, and energetic, they’ll feel that and respond likewise. That alone is attractive. Make it easy for them to get excited <em>with</em> you.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Speak slowly and clearly. Articulation is important. A muddled message is a useless message, and words spoken too quickly get lost. This is where nerves can really mess things up. So breathe. Slow down. And make your points shine with crystal clarity. What’s the right pace? According to research conducted by <a href="https://virtualspeech.com/blog/average-speaking-rate-words-per-minute">VirtualSpeech</a>, a widely-recognized speech training organization, conversational speech falls between 120 to 150 words per minute. Have you ever tested yourself to see if you’re leaving a voicemail at an appropriately-conversational pace? Try it and find out!</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It might seem like success as a real estate agent is only about hitting numbers and climbing ladders. But while that’s true at least to some extent, it’s also about influencing people and building relationships. That’s why the most effective agents are connected to a wide network and they know how to use it to generate leads.</p>
<p>But it takes time to find real estate leads for new agents. And whether you’re starting out or starting over, that can be frustrating.</p>
<p>Just because you’re a new real estate agent doesn’t mean you have to blaze your own trail. There’s a well-worn path to follow. Let’s take a look at some tried-and-true lead generation tips that will set you on the trajectory toward career-long success.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">How to Generate Leads Through Direct Outreach</h2>
<p>The simplest and most obvious place for new agents to get real estate leads is within their own current sphere of influence. Even though you won’t be able to rely solely on your inner circle of connections to generate leads for your entire career, it can provide the open doors you need to get started. There are many ways to market yourself without feeling “salesy”—here are just a few:</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Let friends and family know you can help.</h3>
<p>For every new agent, the odds are high that someone who is part of your family or friend group is currently thinking about selling or buying. If not, they probably know someone who is.</p>
<p>Make sure it’s your name that’s fresh on their mind. Due to the nature of these kinds of relationships, there’s less of a need to pitch. Usually, simply mentioning that you’re in real estate will be enough to open the kind of conversation that results in <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/real-estate-marketing-ideas-for-referrals-repeat-business/">getting more referral leads</a>.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Turn to your wider social circles.</h2>
<p>Think about all of the clubs, organizations, teams, and religious communities that are part of your life. They all fit within your network, and they all present opportunities for you to spread the word about your new profession.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s safe to assume that someone who is connected to you through a shared interest would feel more comfortable working with you than a stranger.</p>
<p>How to Generate Leads Through Digital Outreach</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Be your own content creator.</h3>
<p>People are hungry for accurate, thoughtful real estate advice that’s specific to their city or zip code. Of course they see the headlines about nationwide housing market trends. But what they need is a source of reliable information that pertains to their specific area.</p>
<p>This is where you come in.</p>
<p>As a new agent, you have something very valuable that the veteran agents don’t have: time. And you can leverage that asset by becoming the one who provides insight, advice, and information about local market trends for your prospects.</p>
<p>Maybe for you that looks like writing compelling blog content or creating captivating infographics. Maybe you also focus on alerting leads about the prices of just-sold listings or every highly-desirable home that comes on the market. However it works out for you, amassing a body of high quality, useful information that speaks directly to your audience is one of the <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/how-to-get-real-estate-listings/">best ways for new real estate agents to get leads</a>. (Don’t forget to use city-specific hashtags on your social media channels!)</p>
<p>Consider partnering with a local influencer on a home sale.</p>
<p>You’ll eventually have your own following. But in the meantime, consider connecting with local influencers who already have a large network—for example, radio personalities, social media influencers, or prominent business owners. Ask them if they’re thinking of purchasing. Offer a deal where, for example, you reduce your commission fees in exchange for marketing plugs.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescommunicationscouncil/2020/09/08/the-power-word-of-mouth-has-in-marketing-and-how-to-cultivate-it/?sh=50e02103df02">one study</a>, 63% of consumers between 18 and 34 trust what influencers say about brands more than they trust what a brand says about itself. (With Millennials making up the largest share of home buyers according to <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics/research-reports/home-buyer-and-seller-generational-trends#:~:text=Some%20of%20the%20findings%20this,than%20a%20first%2Dtime%20buyer">NAR</a>, that&#8217;s huge.) And brands that leverage micro-influencers can see a sales increase of up to 18%.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">How to Get Leads Through Business Partnerships</h2>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Develop a friendship with local businesses.</h3>
<p>Small businesses love referrals. And so do you! It’s a win-win.</p>
<p>How do new real estate agents partner with local businesses to generate leads? It’s actually simple.</p>
<p>Make a list of businesses you want to work with. There’s no wrong answer here. It could include a veterinarian office, health-food store, coffee shop, pet groomer, laundromat… you get the idea.</p>
<p>Then go through your list and ask the owner if they’d be willing to allow you to display some marketing materials and business cards at their spot. Tell them that, in return, you’ll refer your clients to their business, feature them on your website, or that you’ll include them in your client “welcome packet” full of your best recommendations and local favorites.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Form partnerships in related fields.</h3>
<p>While you’re thinking of local businesses, be sure to pay close attention to those that are related in some way to real estate. For example: moving companies, brokers, insurance agents, lawyers, and interior designers.</p>
<p>For more ideas, think of your prospects’ buying and selling journey and all of the various types of professionals they’ll interact with along the way. You’ll help them. They’ll help you.</p>
<p>Word-of-mouth marketing continues to be one of the most influential marketing tools across all industries. And that’s especially true for new real estate agents.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Get Leads by Targeting Rentals</h2>
<p>Targeting for-rent-by-owner (FRBO) properties can be a way to generate leads for new agents too. It’s not the same as getting a lead to sell a home. But finding renters can be great practice for a budding real estate agent. And once you do, you’ll likely come across landlords who are beyond interested to hear what you can offer!</p>
<p>Plus, as a side benefit, you’ll begin to form relationships with the landlords. And because you’re top-of-mind, chances are high that you’ll be the agent they work with if they decide to sell or if the tenant decides to buy.</p>
<p>This can be an advantage for new agents because seasoned agents tend to ignore renters. Consider making this your niche. Use a <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/products/professional-for-agents/">robust real estate marketing automation tool</a> to create a newsletter just for renters that provides updates on local housing trends. Include things like snapshots of recent sales, listing updates, reasons why now is a great time to buy, and information on new developments in the area.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Host the Best Open House Ever</h2>
<p>Most open houses feature a cheese plate, a few nosy neighbors, and a bored agent. But it doesn’t have to be that way.</p>
<p>Once you land a listing, make a splash: <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/5-ways-to-maximize-open-houses/">Host an amazing open house.</a> First, create impressive invitations and send them to the whole neighborhood. Next, make sure the food and ambiance are on point. In addition to potentially attracting a buyer on the spot, a big benefit here is that everyone in the neighborhood is going to remember you – “that amazing agent” – when it’s time to sell.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Get Leads by Following up on Major Life Events</h2>
<p>This one takes some detective work, and it may not work for every community. But the idea is to see if your local newspaper has an announcement column and to use that as a way to forecast potential leads.</p>
<p>Reach out to the couples who were recently married or became engaged and see if they’re interested in purchasing a home. Marriages often lead to children, which may require upsizing.</p>
<p>And you could do the same for any retirement or high school graduation announcements you find, too. Because retirement can sometimes lead to a move, and you could be the agent who helps them find their paradise. When high school graduates leave the nest, downsizing often follows.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Pay for Leads</h2>
<p>The best way for new real estate agents to get leads is to buy them. This isn’t a last-ditch effort for the desperate. It’s very common. Most agents use paid leads. And it can be extremely difficult for new agents to gain traction without doing so.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are administrative tasks stealing your time away from clients or other important items on your ever-growing to-do list? Maybe it’s time to consider hiring a real estate virtual assistant.</p>
<p>Most successful business executives, CEOs, and industry leaders get plenty of help. They have advertising agencies to handle ads, marketing companies to promote their services, and administrative assistants to handle the details.<br />
But interestingly, real estate agents are notorious for being the opposite. They’re often reluctant to delegate any tasks and seem to prefer to wear all of the hats in their business.<br />
Too many agents wait to get help until they’re completely overwhelmed because they can no longer juggle all of the demands.</p>
<p>The help you get from an assistant may be more than a mere mental health benefit (as good as that is). It can lead to greater levels of productivity overall.</p>
<p>Mark Young (Stouffer Realty, Northeast Ohio), put it this way: “If you are truly running your business like a real business and you are still overwhelmed, you’re leaving too much money on the table by not adding to your team.”</p>
<p>He’s speaking from personal experience. Young’s business saw a rise in income that he says is positively correlated to the number of staff members he adds to his team.</p>
<p>Maybe for you, getting the help you need looks like hiring a virtual assistant. If so, here’s everything you need to know.</p>
<p style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.8; font-weight: 800;">If you’re too busy, you need help.</p>
<p>For top-producing agents, that’s not a new concept.</p>
<p>Las Vegas’s Jared Jones (Horizon Realty Group), who has been at the top of the list of the country’s most productive agents, credits his ability to handle the volume he does to hiring staff members.</p>
<p>Jones says that too many agents have a “lone ranger” attitude, which prevents them from joining the ranks of the top producers.</p>
<p>“If I had to touch every single piece in the system itself,” he said for the <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/housing/two-valley-real-estate-brokers-land-on-top-10-u-s-sales-list/">Las Vegas Review Journal</a>, “I would never be able to produce multiple amounts of volume. You have to be efficient, and you have to leverage the system (by hiring).”</p>
<p>Adding to your team can lead to higher volume. Noted. But does that mean you should get help from a virtual or on-site assistant?</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Advantages of Hiring a Real Estate Virtual Assistant</h2>
<h3 class="BlogH3">They Can Simultaneously Help You Save Money and Generate Growth</h3>
<p>One of the biggest advantages of hiring a freelance real estate virtual assistant over hiring a full-time, in-house employee is the lower cost.</p>
<p>Virtual real estate assistant pricing varies, but to give you an idea of what to expect, <a href="https://www.indeed.com/career/virtual-assistant/salaries/Bellevue--WA?from=top_sb">the median pay for a virtual assistant</a> in the U.S. hovers around $20 per hour. The <a href="https://www.salary.com/research/salary/posting/licensed-real-estate-assistant-salary/bellevue-wa">median salary for an on-site licensed real estate assistant</a>, however, is around $49,000 per year (or about $24 per hour).</p>
<p>That’s a significant difference, especially because going the freelancer route means you avoid having to provide all of the costly benefits that a full-time, on-site staff member would require, including Social Security, medicare, health insurance, retirement, and the rest.</p>
<p>“You’re not paying for my taxes and my insurance, for one thing,” says Kim Hughes, who owns her own real estate virtual assistance firm (<a href="https://www.kimhughes.com/">Kim Hughes &amp; Company</a>). Plus, you won’t have the costs (and headaches) associated with unemployment insurance when it comes time to part ways.</p>
<p>So meanwhile, as you’re saving money, your virtual assistant is enabling you to drive growth and generate a higher income, as both Young and Jones alluded to earlier.</p>
<p>Ryan Schwartz agrees. Looking for ways to build his business, Schwartz (White Sands Realty, Naples, FL) hired a virtual assistant to make website lead callbacks and to manage his database. He quickly saw the advantages.</p>
<p>Delegating some of the more time-consuming tasks of his business freed him up to build his pipeline and drum up new business. In his words: “A virtual assistant enhances my efficiency and effectiveness.”</p>
<p>Combine the help you get from a real estate virtual assistant with a <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/products/professional-for-agents/">customizable website, robust CRM, and the best marketing automation tools</a>, and you’ll be virtually unstoppable (pun intended).</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">A Real Estate Virtual Assistant Can Also Save You Time</h3>
<p>Setting the monetary cost aside, there’s also a time cost associated with training and managing an on-site employee that you don’t have to spend on a virtual assistant in real estate.</p>
<p>Most of the larger, established real estate virtual assistant firms provide fully trained staff members. So, rather than paying a staff member through the learning curve and taking time out of your schedule to train them, firms and freelancers are ready to roll right into your daily schedule.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">6 Common Tasks You Can Delegate to a Virtual Assistant in Real Estate</h3>
<p>Think about how many tasks you currently perform that take you away from focusing your time and energy on more profitable activities.</p>
<p>Getting them off your plate by delegating them to a virtual assistant can move you to the next level in your business and produce a sweet return on investment.</p>
<p>For example, here are some of the kinds of tasks a real estate virtual assistant can take on for you:</p>
<ol>
<li>Administrative tasks, such as scheduling and transaction coordination</li>
<li>Clear the less-complicated emails out of your inbox</li>
<li>Design and manage your website</li>
<li>Manage your social media accounts</li>
<li>Write the copy for your emails, blog content, and marketing materials</li>
<li>Manage your <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/solutions/crm/">CRM</a></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="BlogH2">What If I Don’t Make Enough Money to Hire a Virtual Assistant?</h2>
<p>Popular real estate coaches used to tell agents that they needed to reach a certain income threshold and remain there consistently before even thinking about hiring an assistant.</p>
<p>But there’s a major flaw in that advice. It fails to take into account that all of the time agents spend doing the work an assistant could have been handling was time spent away from performing the very activities that would allow them to consistently reach the income threshold.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the popularity of that advice has waned. Virtual staffing companies and virtual freelancers allow agents the flexibility to schedule as few or as many hours of assistance per week as needed.</p>
<p>And that means you as the agent have to pay an assistant on a contract or per-task basis, rather than handing out paychecks on a regular, continuous schedule.</p>
<p>That’s especially valuable for agents who are just starting out. They can get help when they need it and save money when they don’t.</p>
<p>Rob Chevez (Keller Williams agent from Reston, VA) realized he needed administrative help. But he wasn’t sure if he could afford a full-time employee.</p>
<p>“I needed simple things done,” he said, “like scanning business cards and putting that information into my database. I just needed someone maybe 20 hours a week, in a role that wasn’t client-facing. So I hired a virtual assistant to do that for me.”</p>
<p>According to Chevez, that’s how many agents take their first baby step into the world of virtual workers. And like him, they quickly learn that production increases as they focus on their most important tasks.</p>
<p>“I started getting a lot busier,” he said, which eventually led him to take the bigger step of hiring a full-time assistant – who, like his first one, works virtually from home.</p>
<p>Feeling a little unsure about whether hiring a virtual assistant is the best next step for your business? Maybe start with an intern. <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/real-estate-interns/">Here’s everything you need to know about real estate internships.</a></p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/real-estate-virtual-assistant/">Should I Hire a Real Estate Virtual Assistant?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>
