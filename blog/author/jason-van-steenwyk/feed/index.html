										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-33821" title="Real estate investor" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/investor-200x300.jpg" alt="Tips for real estate agents on how to work with investors" width="200" height="300" />Many new real estate agents dream of tapping into a network of investors who constantly buy and sell homes, imagining that it will provide an easy route to commissions and repeat business.</p>
<p>But when they actually hook an investor client—or<em> think</em> that they have—then, it’s often a different story.</p>
<p>Here’s the deal: The investment property sale is a very different process than a residential sale to an owner-occupant. With owner-occupants, you are selling the dream. You’re selling the home-sweet-home, the pitter-patter-of-little-feet, the cinnamon-in-the-kitchen, hearth-and-home fantasy ideal. Tap into that dream and the client’s bought it.</p>
<p>With investors, it’s a whole different ballgame. The successful investor has ice water in his or her veins. You’re not selling a dream; you’re selling ROI. If the number is there and it beats the investor’s hurdle rate, <em>and</em> you get the timing right, then you should have a sale.</p>
<p>But hitting that hurdle rate is <em>hard—</em>especially with an agent’s full commission thrown in the mix.</p>
<p>What’s more, lots of people will blow smoke, calling themselves “investors.” They will get you to do a ton of unpaid legwork for them, when in reality they’re all hat and no cattle. They either don’t have the capital to do the deal, or they are looky-loos and tire-kickers, or they’re just emotionally unable to pull the trigger on a property, no matter how much financial sense it makes.</p>
<p>Yes, investors can be lucrative clients for some. But it isn’t a market for everybody. Here are 10 success strategies for working with investors as a real estate agent:</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">1. Know the Basics</h2>
<p>The investor market is all about efficiency. Margins are compressed and commissions are frequently squeezed in the process. This isn’t the market for agents who need a lot of handholding, or for those who take a lot of time at each point of the transaction to get it right. You should come into the game already knowing how to block, tackle, throw and catch.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">2. Learn the Language</h2>
<p>Investors speak a different language than folks in the conventional residential real estate world, where you’re marketing houses to owner-occupants. You need to understand terms like “<a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hurdlerate.asp">hurdle rate,”</a> “<a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalizationrate.asp">cap rate</a>,” “<a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irr.asp">internal rate of return”</a> and “income vs. capital gains,” and have a solid understanding of how 1031 exchanges work. Your knowledge of real estate math has to be deeper than just a mortgage calculator.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">3. Speed Is Essential</h2>
<p>Time is money. Investor clients want answers quickly and they want their paperwork done quickly. You should have the bandwidth available to get the paperwork done fast, or have the staff available to do a first rate job.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">4. Limit Engagement on the Front End</h2>
<p>The best investors probably don’t need you to send them MLS listings—they’re beating the streets to find properties and motivated buyers <em>before</em> they come up on the MLS! For this reason, some investors will just need to hand you the football for the offer process. Since your front-end work is reduced, it may make sense to give up something in commissions.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">5. Never Offer too Much</h2>
<p>Never give away the store just to get an investor deal. <strong>Get something in return.</strong> If you give up commission percentage in order to get a deal, make sure to get a commitment to represent the investor on the other side when he or she lists the house.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">6. Prequalify the Investor</h2>
<p>Where is the money coming from? Do they have their own money? Are they preapproved? It’s best to have a business meeting up front. You don’t have to be too nosy, but you do have the right to ensure that you won’t get caught doing a lot of legwork for nothing because they can’t get financing for the properties they bid on.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">7. Leverage Your E&amp;O Policy</h2>
<p>Don’t forget that you have a card to play, too. Whether they realize it or not, sellers benefit from your errors and omissions insurance policy. That policy doesn’t just protect you; it also protects the owners you work with. If nothing else, that coverage is worth a percent or two. It can be a powerful argument against a seller who is flirting with the idea of a for-sale-by-owner approach. Owners looking to circumvent using a licensed real estate professional may pocket the commission—but they are taking on <em>all </em>of the liability, too.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">8. Only Work With Pros</h2>
<p>Make sure you’re working with mature individuals—not just some yahoos who want to alienate the market by making ridiculously low-ball offers on property after property, hoping to find a desperate seller by pure luck. They may succeed, but only by making you go through a lot of time and hassle on the front end, and possibly souring the market—not just for them, but for you as well, because you become associated with low-balling clients.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">9. Ask “How, Exactly, can I Help?”</h2>
<p>An investor client may have some tasks in mind that are quite different than your traditional role. He may want to handle offers and have you strictly handling paperwork. He may want your broker’s license to handle renting and leasing. He may just want you as a consultant—especially if he’s a new investor. It may be something different altogether. It’s much better to establish the scope of the engagement at the beginning of the process than at the end of it. Concentrate on finding sustainable, win-win solutions up front. The best investors want that, too, and will appreciate finding a reliable partner in their real estate practice.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">10. Present Listings the Proper Way</h2>
<p>Don’t give an investor client the same glossy presentation binder you give to everyone else. They’ll throw it in the trash. Those things are designed for the retail buyer, not the investor who buys wholesale. Investors would rather work things out on the back of a bar napkin with someone who “gets it” than receive a 30-page, glossy computer-generated “proposal” on the agency’s house software program with someone who doesn’t.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/working-with-investors-real-estate-agent/">How to Work With Investors as a Real Estate Agent</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The key to longevity in the real estate world is never a single deal: <em>It’s a disciplined, rational and systematic approach to developing future deals.</em></p>
<p>You can do that without having had much previous good luck. But it’s really hard to do that and stay unlucky! Here’s how to build and manage a sales pipeline that should help you generate not just one deal, but a steady stream of future deals.</p>
<h2>1. Put a System in Place</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-32831" title="Sales Pipeline Management" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Fotolia_52547423_XS-300x225.jpg" alt="One of the keys to success for real estate pros is effectively managing a sales pipeline" width="300" height="225" />The most important thing is to take action <em>now.</em></p>
<p>In the past, agents and salespeople of all stripes used a variety of paper systems.</p>
<p>A legendary insurance salesperson named Al Granum systematized his lead management system with index cards and a small metal file box he kept in the front seat of his car. Much of the success of Northwestern Mutual was built on Al’s low-tech system and training. Since then, Northwestern digitized their system, which became very widely admired and emulated all over the insurance industry. Al Granum died in 2014, at the age of 91. But his legacy is immense: The system he developed has become the backbone of many a successful salesperson, both in and out of the insurance industry.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today: Computer programmers have built on the successful OneCard system that Al Granum pioneered in the insurance agency and adopted the sales pipeline concept for their own industries. Naturally, the unique marketing and sales processes of the real estate industry call for their own solution, designed specifically for the real estate business.</p>
<p>The decision is easy for today’s real estate agents: a fully integrated sales pipeline management system designed especially for real estate professionals.</p>
<p>A great <a href="http://www.marketleader.com/products/professional-for-agents/">CRM </a>makes it a snap to import your business contacts and to sort them into the appropriate categories within a fully integrated solution. In addition to lead management, a solid CRM system should offer the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy integration with MLS.</li>
<li>A personally branded website – designed specifically to capture leads.</li>
<li>“Market Insider” reports designed to highlight you as the neighborhood expert.</li>
<li>Marketing Design Center with professionally-designed resources to power your brand.</li>
<li>Professional education and training programs.</li>
<li>Activity tracking with alerts and reminders.</li>
<li>Fast property flyer editing and creation.</li>
<li>Professional printing from Shutterfly.</li>
<li>Seamless<a href="/blog/market-leader-partners-with-dotloop-to-create-a-seamless-lead-to-close-experience-for-real-estate-professionals/"> lead-to-close</a> experience with dotloop integration.</li>
<li>Mobile access, so you can work your system from anywhere.</li>
</ul>
<p>For managing brokers and franchise owners, the tools available are even more robust, including lead capture and distribution, tracking tools, ROI measurements, and much more.</p>
<h2>2. Feed the Beast <strong>       </strong></h2>
<p>Now that you have a backbone in place, it’s time to flesh it out with contacts from your marketing efforts. This can be a time-consuming process, because at a minimum you’ll want to key in a phone number, an email address, and some notes about how you know this prospect and what you’ve talked about.</p>
<p>Where are these contacts going to come from?</p>
<ul>
<li>Your own existing natural market.</li>
<li>Satisfied clients.</li>
<li>Referrals.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.marketleader.com/products/real-estate-leads/">Real estate leads services</a></li>
<li>Contacts acquired from your own marketing and prospecting efforts on top of these:
<ul>
<li>Advertising</li>
<li>Networking</li>
<li>Direct mail</li>
<li>Phone prospecting</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You want to have a single, organized software backbone to feed all of these contacts into. Eliminate “leakage.” Leakage is any name that you struggled or paid for that became a contact and then fell through the cracks. Any leak is wasted time or wasted money.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as a bad lead &#8211; All contact are viable, if you work them.</p>
<h2>3. Work Your System</h2>
<p>The great part about having a fully developed sales pipeline is that all of a sudden, every day, when you arrive at your office or start your day, <em>you have a track to run on!</em></p>
<p>Many agents and other sales professionals get overwhelmed by the sheer vastness of the potential market and all the things that need to be done – as well as all the things the agent <em>thinks</em> need to be done that aren’t really that important.</p>
<p>Don’t get tunnel vision with one aspect of the pipeline. Yes, you should prioritize moving prospects from “qualified” to “paid.” That’s what will get you operating capital to stay in the business. But you can’t spend all your time there. You’ll wind up with a few deals paid and no idea where your next commission check is coming from. You have to spend a substantial amount of time adding new names to the pipeline through your real estate prospecting and marketing efforts.</p>
<p>Remember that it will probably take at least 10 appointments to get to three proposals, and of these you may eventually get one sale. The 10:3:1 ratio seems to be fairly constant in all kinds of sales environments. So let that be a guide to how much time you spend on expanding and working with your pipeline.</p>
<p>Another advantage to a well-developed pipeline management program is it allows you to reverse engineer your business to meet target commission earnings over the next year. If you know your average commission rate, and you know you will close an average of 2 to 3 percent of leads, and you have an idea of the average price of homes in your market, you can figure out how many leads you need to have to meet your income goals.</p>
<p>Confused? Don’t be. Our <a href="http://www.marketleader.com/leadcalculator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lead Calculator</a> will walk you through it.</p>
<h2>4. Manage It</h2>
<p>This one is for you, managers and mentors out there. Insist that your agents put in the elbow grease in maintaining a good sales pipeline document. This can go a long way toward helping you help them.  Agents, help your manager help you!</p>
<p>Go down your list. Are there deals that you think are dying? This is where you can get help resurrecting them. Your manager may be able to help you develop a strategy or tool to keep a deal moving forward.</p>
<p>Agents should be prepared to discuss every name in their pipeline. Managers should expect agents to have a plan for every name in their pipeline. Managers should compare their agents’ pipelines week-to-week and month-to-month. If there’s not much movement, you have a problem. The agent may not have the skills to keep the names flowing, or may not have the will. Either situation requires an energetic response from leadership.</p>
<h2>5. Upgrade It</h2>
<p>If you’re on paper already, or you’re using an outdated, legacy CRM program, upgrade as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Struggling agents can quickly have a benchmark to improve against by comparing their early-stage lead capture and appointment metrics to those who are more successful. For example, when you show a struggling agent that they are averaging one appointment per day and compare it with a successful agent’s report that shows three kept appointments most days, that can be a powerful motivator and learning tool.</p>
<p>Of course, I’m a big believer in tracking metrics and their trends over time, but these tools are only as good as the effort with which agents input their data into the system. That’s why it’s important to invest in the best program, with an intuitive interface that makes it easy for agents to keep up their stats.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Being a real estate agent isn’t just about getting listings and showing houses. Many times, you’ll also need to help develop prospective buyers – turning them from renters into homeowners by coaching them on their credit and how to improve their access to financing.</p>
<p>It isn’t about getting them into bigger loans than they can afford. It’s about maximizing their choices (and your commissions.) The bottom line: The better your clients’ credit score, the lower the interest rate, and the bigger the mortgage they will qualify for at any level of income.</p>
<p>Many real estate agents are facing an uphill battle when it comes to credit. <a href="http://assetsandopportunity.org/assets/pdf/2015_Scorecard_Report.pdf">According to a recent survey</a> from the Corporation for Enterprise Development, the majority of Americans have subprime-level credit scores. Simply put, America’s credit sucks.</p>
<p>With today’s tools, there’s no reason for any buyer, or real estate agent helping a buyer, to get surprised by a credit turn-down when applying for a mortgage to buy an owner-occupied home. If the buyer doesn’t walk in with a prequalification letter in hand, always run a credit check and address any issues on the front end. Here are some steps to help make the credit process easier, for both of you.</p>
<h2>1. Check Your Client’s Credit</h2>
<p>How can you run a credit check? It’s easy nowadays. First, everyone is entitled to one free credit report per year from each of the major credit bureaus. If a client doesn’t have a recent one handy, the beginning of the househunting process is a great time to pull it.</p>
<p>Second, you can use the credit bureau services themselves. For example, <a href="http://www.experian.com/connect/real-estate-brokers-agents-check-clients-credit.html">Experian Connect</a> allows real estate professionals to review a client’s credit report and score. The client pays a fee of $14.95.</p>
<h2>2. Review the Credit Report Together</h2>
<p>Go over the credit report with your prospect, line by line. Are there any false reports? Identify them, and educate your client on how to get them removed from the credit report.</p>
<h2>3. Take Care of Any Late Debts</h2>
<p>Are there any late debts that can quickly be brought current? Take care of those right away. You don’t want to get to the mortgage application stage with anything currently delinquent, whatsoever. Take care of all the 30-, 60- and 90-day delinquent ash and trash that shows up, and keep things current until the ink on the deed is dry.</p>
<h2>4. Pay Off Old Debts</h2>
<p>Are there any old debts that can be paid off or settled? A “paid” notation looks a lot better than a “settled” one, but “settled” will do in a pinch.</p>
<p>One bit of news: The newest update to the Fair Isaac Corporation’s software that determines credit scores, known as FICO 9, actually bypasses old debts that have been paid off or settled in full. The new algorithm also cuts creditors some slack by not weighting medically-related debt as much. The bad news: That won’t mean much for mortgage applicants for a while. Almost no one in the business has adopted FICO 9 as its underwriting standard. Most of the banking and mortgage industry is still on FICO 4, released years ago.</p>
<h2>5. Pay Down Existing Balances on Credit Cards</h2>
<p>Sure, it’s ok to have one or two credit cards. But advise clients to keep the utilization rate down – ideally to 10 percent or less. You want to be able to show the bank that your buyer has some wiggle room. Things aren’t maxed out. This shows the bank two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your clients are able to live within their means.</li>
<li>They have some credit headroom in the event of an unanticipated cash crunch or emergency.</li>
</ul>
<p>When it comes to available credit, it’s better to have it and not need it than to need it and not have it – or to have it used up!</p>
<h2>6. Ask Creditors to Drop Late Payment Reports</h2>
<p>Is the customer’s record clean except for one or two 30-day-late reports? It won’t hurt to ask the creditor for a “goodwill deletion.”</p>
<p>Another possible approach is re-aging. Here’s how it works: If a client went through a cash crunch at some time in the past and fell behind on some bills, but the crisis is over and the client is able to show the creditor an ability to pay, the lender may be willing to “re-age” the account. That is, essentially drop late payments and late fees from the record.</p>
<p>You can’t go to that well too often, though. Many lenders won’t do it more than once in a one-to-five year period. Others won’t do it unless there’s a formal payoff plan in place, set up by a credit counseling organization. But nobody dings a FICO score just for asking.</p>
<h2>7. Ask Creditors to Lower a Client’s Interest Rate</h2>
<p>Ask credit card issuers if they can lower the interest rate on a good customer. Most lenders would rather do that than have a customer transfer a balance. Your customer’s debt is an <em>asset</em> to the bank! If you can get a credit card company to lower the interest rate, you also lower the monthly minimum debt service. This improves the debt-to-income ratio and makes it that much easier for an iffy application to qualify for a loan, or to get bumped up to a better risk category.</p>
<h2>8. Educate Prospects About Credit Counseling Services</h2>
<p>Not every credit counselor is legit, and there are many scams out there preying on desperate people pursuing the dream of homeownership. For clients who choose to use a credit counseling service, <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0153-choosing-credit-counselor">share this information</a> from the Federal Trade Commission with them.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/9-ways-to-help-clients-improve-credit-scores/">9 Ways to Help Clients Improve Credit Scores</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

<p>Of course, many real estate agents are working a niche, and local markets can vary widely. In general though, I’m a big advocate of what I call “selling to the fat part of the bell curve.” That means marketing and advertising to the broadest number of people who have an interest in buying or selling a home – <em>and</em> have the financial ability to do so. This involves gathering as much information as you can about your bread-and-butter prospects, including demographic, financial and behavioral data.</p>
<p>So, here is what we know about homebuyers in 2014. This valuable resource can help you better market your services to buyers in your area.</p>
<h2>Key Findings From the Annual NAR Report</h2>
<p>The National Association of Realtors® recently released their annual publication of real estate statistics, the <strong><a href="http://www.realtor.org/sites/default/files/reports/2014/2014-profile-of-home-buyers-and-sellers-highlights.pdf">2014 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers</a></strong>.</p>
<h3>Key Facts From the Report About Buyers</h3>
<ul>
<li>Forty percent of buyers choose their agent as a result of a referral from a friend or family member.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Most buyers – two-thirds of them – only interview one agent.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Buyers look at an average of 10 homes before buying.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The new home search lasts for an average of 10 weeks – down from 12 weeks in 2012.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>First-time homebuyers are still down from historical levels. Thirty-three percent of recent homebuyers were first-time buyers. The historical norm is about 40 percent.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The average age of first-time buyers: 31. The median household income of first-time buyers is $68,300.</li>
</ul>
<ul>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Sixty-five percent of recent homebuyers were married couples.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>More buyers are using agents: 89 percent of buyers used a real estate agent or broker. That’s up strongly from 69 percent in 2001.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The simple desire to own a home was the number one motivator for purchases, with 24 percent reporting this as their leading reason to buy.  It far outstrips those who bought because of a job change involving relocation (9 percent), and those who bought because their family situation changed (8 percent).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Ninety-two percent of homebuyers used the internet during their home search. (How’s your website looking?)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The average age of a home purchased in 2014: 21 years.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The average size of a home purchased in 2014: 1,870 square feet.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The average home sold in 2014 had three bedrooms and two bathrooms.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The average number of years buyers expect to remain in their homes: 12.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Single-family homes were by far the most popular, accounting for 79 percent of homes sold in 2014.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Only 13 percent of buyers over age 50 bought a home in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pxQVejXwts">senior-related development.</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Almost 9 in 10 buyers seriously considered heating and cooling costs when deciding whether to buy.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Familiarize yourself with your area’s <a href="https://www.walkscore.com/">Walk Score</a>: 7 of 10 buyers consider commuting costs when making their decision.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Millennial Buyer Dilemma</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/04/30/homeownership-for-millennials-declines-to-historic-lows">Millennials are lagging far behind</a> when it comes to homeownership, compared to previous generations at their age, according to U.S. News &amp; World Report.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Nevertheless, the under-30 crowd would like to own someday – 74 percent expect to move in the next five years. During this time, millennials will form 8.3 million new households, <a href="http://demandinstitute.org/sites/default/files/blog-uploads/millennials-and-their-homes-final.pdf">reports the Demand Institute.</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Key NAR Figures on Home Sellers</h3>
<ul>
<li>Nine percent of sellers attempted to do a FSBO (For Sale By Owner) transaction.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Homes sold directly by owners sold at significantly lower prices, on average, than homes sold via a real estate agent: $208,700 vs. $235,000.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Agents, on average, delivered 13 percent more value to the seller than those selling on their own, all other things being equal.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Important Mortgage Data</h2>
<p>For mortgage data, we turn to the <a href="http://www.elliemae.com/origination-insight-reports/Ellie_Mae_OIR_DECEMBER2014.pdf">December 2014 Origination Insight Report</a>, published by leading mortgage industry software maker Ellie Mae.</p>
<ul>
<li>The average FICO score for loan applicants who actually received approval on mortgages was 728. This figure has not changed much since 2013.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The average FICO score on mortgages that were denied was 679.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Average loan-to-value ratio on approved loans was down slightly, to 80 percent. Debt-to-income ratios averaged a 34/38 front end/back end.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>On average, the debt-to-income ratio on denied applications was 29/46. This, of course, is very useful information to share with clients in the process of building up their credit before trying to buy a home.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’ve all seen them: Websites that are supposed to sell, but wind up making their owners look dumb, inept or out of touch. We live in a digital era. According to the <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/reports/2014/2014-profile-of-home-buyers-and-sellers-highlights.pdf">2014 NAR Profile of Homebuyers and Sellers:</a></p>
<ul>
<li>92 percent of homebuyers use the Internet when looking for information</li>
<li>76 percent of buyers view homes or drive by homes for sale that they first find online</li>
<li>43 percent of buyers found their home on the Internet</li>
</ul>
<p>This business is tough enough, but if your website is making you look like you’re stuck in the 90s, while the rest of the real estate industry is moving on without you, you’re ceding a massive marketplace to competitors.</p>
<p>Here are eight vital signs your website presence needs a massive overhaul to catch up with the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p>
<h2>Have a Flash Intro on Your Website</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-45721" title="bad real estate website" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bad-real-estate-website-200x300.jpg" alt="Signs Your Website Is Stuck in the Dark Ages" width="200" height="300" />This is especially true if there’s text in the Flash imagery. Search engines can’t read text in a Flash animation. To the internet robots, they just look like image files. It’s like handing a photocopy of a braille book to a blind man and asking him to read it. It just doesn’t work. If you have text in a Flash piece, retype it into regular text. Then dump the Flash.</p>
<h2>Cheesy Glam Photos</h2>
<p>You’ve seen them. Photos of agents with 80s feathered hair that’s been out of style since Frankie went to Hollywood, complete with a pantyhose effect over the lens. Leave the glam shots for your high school yearbook, and go get a proper portrait done.</p>
<h2>Crummy E-mail Addresses</h2>
<p>Real estate agents are professionals. People entrust hundreds of thousands, even millions of dollars, to their care. If you have an email address like fairyangel1000@aol.com or harleydude51@yahoo.com, that’s one more item that undermines the trust that people have in you. Invest in a real email address and domain.</p>
<h2>No Lead Capture Functionality</h2>
<p>Not having this feature alone can kill your practice as a real estate agent. Consumers are now more used to entering basic information into a form, to give you permission to contact them. If a customer wants to see a house, they’ll be willing to let a professional agent contact them about it. Even if it doesn’t lead to an immediate sale, lead capture functionality is a key way of adding contacts to your drip marketing program. Plus, your lead capture system is a powerful defense against any accusation that you violated Do Not Call rules.</p>
<h2>Not Mobile Friendly</h2>
<p>Sure, you’ve had your site up for years. But have you actually looked at it on an iPhone? An Android phone or tablet? You need to do that regularly. Just because a site works on your desktop doesn’t mean it’s not loading up as gibberish on a mobile device.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-45751" title="consumer using smartphone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/consumer-using-smartphone-300x300.jpg" alt="Real estate website mistake: not being mobile-friendly" width="250" height="250" />When a potential homebuyer drives by one of your listings, sees your sign in front of the house and wants to look up the online listing, do you think they’re going to write the information down in a notebook and drive home to a big screen desktop? No! They’re going to look you up, on the spot, on their smartphone. If your site is legible and functional, and they’re interested, they’ll call you or drop their contact info in your lead capture system.</p>
<p>According to research by iAquire, 40 percent of users will give up if your site is not mobile friendly. You will never see or hear from them. Furthermore, 70 percent of searches on mobile sites lead to actions on websites within one hour.</p>
<h2>Bad Stock Photography</h2>
<p>Increasingly, consumers are accustomed to seeing homes marketed with beautiful imagery. Think of high-end magazine photography, like Real Simple and Architectural Digest<em>.</em> Your website’s top images should convey an elegant and refined look. Most cheap or free stock photo sites are nowhere near the industry standard. For the purposes of branding you and your business, invest in some proper images.</p>
<h2>Bad Agent Photography</h2>
<p>If you’re not a camera fiend, get a professional photographer to take photographs for you. Actually, you should probably do this anyway. You’re not a professional photographer – even if it’s a passion in your private life. You’re a real estate agent.</p>
<p>Every minute you spend setting up the perfect shot and tweaking the image on Photoshop is a minute better spent on the phone, talking to contacts and setting up listings, showings and closings. And counting your commission checks. Photography is a non-core activity for you. Delegate it as soon as you can. See more <a href="/blog/lessons-from-the-worst-real-estate-photographers/">tips on real estate photography</a>.</p>
<h2>Poor Social Media Integration</h2>
<p>It’s important for websites to have interactivity and to allow easy, seamless sharing of listings, blog posts, articles and other content via social media. If you spent time writing a great blog post or informative article, you’ve probably branded it with your name and contact information. If it’s useful, people will want to share it with friends. And if it makes you look like an expert, you want this information shared as much as possible. It builds your credibility and helps you grow your business. Make sure your social sharing tools are easy to find.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/8-signs-your-website-is-stuck-in-the-dark-ages/">8 Signs Your Website Is Stuck in the Dark Ages</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes down to it, real estate agents aren’t really in the real estate business – just as restaurant owners aren’t really in the food service business and roofers aren’t in the roofing business.</p>
<p>Sure, houses, land, apartments and storefronts are the commodities you help people buy and sell – but you’re still not in the real estate business. You’re in the <strong><em>people</em></strong> business. And, assuming you make a reasonable effort at mastering the real estate trade and the basics of managing your practice, if you are excellent at connecting with <em>people,</em> you cannot fail.</p>
<p>So, what are the secrets of the masters when it comes to connecting with people? A thousand books could not hold them all, but here are some great ones.</p>
<h2>1. Do Not Forget <em>Anybody</em></h2>
<p>Some years back, I had an insurance agent named Larry Mervis. Larry was a WWII veteran – a captain and military intelligence officer who landed on Normandy Beach and served in the U.S. Army across Europe, all the way to Germany. Prior to D-Day, he actually met then-General Dwight D. Eisenhower, who was deep in the planning phases of the Normandy invasion. Ike asked about Larry’s family, and Larry told Ike he was worried about his father, a doctor in Chicago who was in ill health.</p>
<p>They didn’t meet again for over a year and a half. Then in Germany, shortly before the end of the war, their paths crossed again. “Larry! Larry Mervis!” exclaimed Eisenhower. “Good to see you! You told me back in England that your dad was falling ill. How’s he doing?”</p>
<p>Eisenhower was at the vortex of one of the most seminal events in history – with the fate of millions under his responsibility – and he still remembered a lowly captain by name, and his sick father back home. Larry was a loyal and devoted Eisenhower supporter for the rest of his life. Eisenhower was an ace at connecting with people – of all ranks.</p>
<h2>2. Reach Out During Crises</h2>
<p>In Rudy Giuliani’s excellent book, “Leadership,” the former Mayor of New York City writes at length about the importance of being present at funerals. He wrote that as mayor, of course he couldn’t attend every wedding or graduation he was invited to, but he worked very hard never to miss a police officer, firefighter or other city employee’s funeral. People remember who was there for them when the chips were down. They remember who made the effort. If someone you know is going through a crisis, be the one to pick up the phone. Make the effort.</p>
<h2>3. Catch People Doing a Good Job</h2>
<p>As a young army officer on a very cold day in Fort Knox, Kentucky, I went to the wash rack where my platoon was knocking mud and grime off the tanks after a field exercise. It was cold and miserable, and even though it was work typically conducted by enlisted men and non-commissioned officers, I wanted to be where things were happening.</p>
<p>Someone was underneath the tank in near freezing weather, going the extra mile with a pressure hose while getting soaking wet, cold and miserable in the process. I wriggled on my back under the tank to see who it was, I told him I saw what he was doing and appreciated the hard work, and in the process, I got as cold and miserable as he was.</p>
<p>That action came back to me a year later, when I learned from some of the non-commissioned officers and soldiers who were there, that that day made me as a leader. When I crawled under that tank, crawled out wet and freezing, and stayed out there with them, I made the transition from being<em> the</em> platoon leader to being <em>their</em> platoon leader.</p>
<h2>4. Build Strong Teams</h2>
<p>For starters, you should have an assistant. Maybe two. There’s a team right there. But as a real estate agent, you also represent your brokerage. You’re the link between the client, the lister or buyer and his or her agent, the title company, the underwriters, an attorney or two, and the many other people who pitch in to make transactions happen.</p>
<p>Take the initiative to make this team more effective – but be consistent with your experience level and expertise. A brand new rookie agent may not be able to do this as much with veteran colleagues. But you absolutely can and should be building up your own assistant, and helping them learn and grow.</p>
<p>Occasionally they may outgrow you, and leave. This is part of life. Take pride in your team members, never stop teaching them, and make them stronger. Even ones who leave will be your brand ambassadors and evangelizers for many years to come.</p>
<h2>5. Put Your Cell Phone Down!</h2>
<p>When you’re talking to someone, keep your cell phone face down on the table. Don’t even look at it. If it rings, there’s an opportunity for you to look someone in the eye and say, “It can wait. You’re the most important thing in my world right now.”</p>
<h2>6. Learn Another Language</h2>
<p>You don’t have to be fluent in it. Just make an effort, and seek out opportunities to speak it with native speakers whenever possible. Nothing but good will come of it.</p>
<p>I have an uncle who is fluent in Spanish and Portuguese as well as English, and who spent many years in South America directing sales efforts for a major American financial services company. He has two doctorates and is an expert on international finance. But he’s at his most impressive when chatting up a waitress or maintenance worker from Cuba, Columbia or Guatemala – because even though he can dial up his language and interaction skills to the C-suite level, he got there precisely because he has a knack for making the person in front of him feel appreciated and important.</p>
<p>And no – I never once saw him read messages on a cell phone when talking to someone in person – ever.</p>
<h2>7. Send “Thank You” Notes</h2>
<p>Every day. A small pack of “Thank You” cards will generate more ROI than any other investment you will ever make. Always handwrite them, and handwrite the address.</p>
<p>They don’t have to be fancy. I’ve gotten callbacks from plain old 3-by-5 inch index cards. I’d travel with a pack of cards and a book of stamps, and I’d mail a handwritten thank you to everyone who spoke with me that day. That was my discipline before I went home – get a cup of coffee and get my cards out, that day. The phone will ring.</p>
<p>Naturally, there are many, many other techniques and principles like these that you can utilize. It’s up to you to adapt them to your practice, your personality and your environment.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8212;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like many small businesses, real estate agents have been enjoying a pretty sweet deal on Facebook for a while now. We all know how vital word-of-mouth is to real estate agents – especially to newer agents who don’t have a ton of cash flow for traditional forms of advertising.</p>
<p>In recent years, many agents have taken to Facebook to promote their businesses and get the word out about listings, sales and open houses. For the most part, Facebook has been looking the other way on these kinds of posts. But it now looks like the days of freebie promotions on Facebook are over.</p>
<h2>The Blowback on Promotional Posts</h2>
<p>Facebook recently announced a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/update-to-facebook-news-feed">crackdown on unpaid posts</a> that are “too promotional,” which the company defines as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Posts that hawk a specific product for sale or ask users to download an app.</li>
<li>Anything having to do with entering promotions, sweepstakes and raffles without any sense of context.</li>
<li>Posts that essentially rehash content from ads.</li>
</ul>
<p>These posts were causing complaints from Facebook users, according to the company, and some anecdotal evidence suggests that some users have actually stopped using Facebook because they were tired of all the advertising and promotion.</p>
<p>The kicker: It wasn’t companies that paid for advertisements that were the most guilty of turning off users. Facebook can control the number and quality of paid ads that appear in a user’s news feed. Rather, businesses that users “liked” on Facebook – essentially signing up for their feeds – were the primary culprit.</p>
<p>If you’ve been posting overly promotional content on your feed, Facebook’s management has essentially fired a shot across your bow. Competition to appear in Newsfeeds will increase substantially, starting in January. Abuse your feed, and your page reach will fall significantly over time.</p>
<h2>Time to Revamp Your Facebook Strategy</h2>
<p>This doesn’t mean you can’t continue to use your Facebook page to promote your real estate practice. Far from it. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/a/page-posting-tips">Facebook encourages it</a>. But if you’ve been lazy about providing value-added content for your “likers” and friends, with posts that rarely go beyond obnoxiously hawking your services, you’ll need to completely re-do your Facebook strategy.</p>
<p><strong>To create valuable content for your followers, focus on these ideas:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use Facebook to establish yourself as an expert or thought leader within your niche. Brand yourself as an expert by providing timely information that people want to read.</li>
<li>Provide a service to your readers with every post.</li>
<li>Target your posts carefully. You can do this in your “Settings” on Facebook Pages. Click “Settings,” then “Targeting and Privacy.” You can target your posts by location, sex, age, interests, education, language and more.</li>
<li>Do you have a specific promotion going? Then by all means promote, or boost, your posts. Spend a few dollars, if you can – but if you’re spending money, you’d <em>better</em> be targeting!</li>
<li>Post regularly. That’s what gives you “top of mind” awareness with your market. When people think “real estate in my neighborhood,” you want them to think of your name. That means you’re going to have to hit them with a couple of dozen impressions before you make the short list of people they will call when they want to buy, sell or rent a property.</li>
<li>Reinforce success. Did one of your posts get an unusual amount of interest and engagement? Pay a few dollars and promote it to increase its reach. You already know the message is effective. You can’t do better testing than that.</li>
<li>Use pictures, links and hashtags with your posts. Studies show that these get more retweets, likes, comments and overall engagement than posts with text only, says Carol Fowler, CEO of KloboMedia, a Chicago-based firm that advises small businesses on social media strategy.</li>
<li>Don’t have a Facebook Page for your business? If you’re just using a personal account, rather than a business page, you can still advertise on Facebook. Those ads will only show up in the right-hand column of pages, though, not in Newsfeeds.</li>
<li>Change your cover photo. Keep some branding elements constant, but switch other things up.</li>
<li>Make use of Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/336893449723054/">Insights</a>, which is their counterpart to Google Analytics. Insights is a valuable tool to help measure reader responses to posts, both in terms of reach (how many unique people saw your post) and engagement (how many people shared, liked or commented on it).</li>
</ul>
<p>Facebook isn’t the only game in town, of course. LinkedIn is also a very powerful resource for targeting educated professionals.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Starting about February, the financial media will be going gangbusters publishing ideas for tax deductions. That’s too late, though, for a lot of things. To take full advantage of tax planning opportunities, you need to take some steps now – prior to December 31<sup>st</sup> – to claim a deduction on your tax return when filing time comes in April. Or August. Or October. Whatever.</p>
<h2>1. Buy Software</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/tax-tips-for-agents.jpg" alt="Year-End Tax Tips for Real Estate Agents" title="tax tips for agents" width="250" height="203" class="alignright size-full wp-image-43911" />Admittedly, Trulia’s a company that sells software, so we’re not exactly a dispassionate observer. But you should know that software you buy for the purpose of running your real estate business is not only depreciable, it’s tax deductible in the first year, under <a href="https://www.section179.org/section_179_and_software/">Section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code</a>.</p>
<p>While the cost of custom-made software has to be depreciated over 36 months, Section 179 allows you to deduct the entire cost of off-the-shelf software, such as <a href="/products/professional-for-agents/">Market Leader’s Professional</a>, in the first year.</p>
<p>So, if you’ve been putting off investment in software you need to make sooner or later, now’s the time to pull the trigger – before the year’s end. You need to place the software into service this year, <strong>before December 31<sup>st</sup></strong>, to qualify for the first year deduction – subject to an overall limit of $25,000 for all Section 179 deductions for tax year 2014.</p>
<p>What qualifies as “off-the-shelf” software?</p>
<ul>
<li>Software that is readily available for purchase by the general public.</li>
<li>Software that is subject to a non-exclusive license.</li>
<li>Software that has not been substantially modified.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of software you may need include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Office Suite</li>
<li>Accounting software such as QuickBooks or Intuit</li>
<li>Market Leader</li>
<li>Security or Antivirus applications like Norton or McAfee</li>
<li>Project management programs</li>
<li>Payroll processing programs</li>
<li>Graphics and creative programs</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also deduct the cost of leasing or renting software, such as Adobe’s Creative Suite.</p>
<h2>2. Buy Mobile Devices</h2>
<p>Again, if you have been putting off that tablet purchase that will help you show properties or capture visitor information at open houses, pull the trigger prior to the end of the year.</p>
<p>While computers are normally depreciable over several years under <a href="https://www.irs.gov/publications/p946">MACRS rules</a> (meaning you have to spread out your deductions), <a href="https://www.section179.org/property_that_qualifies_for_section_179/">Section 179</a> also applies to computers and most kinds of tangible property put into service prior to the end of the year. If you hold off until after December 31<sup>st</sup>, you’ll have to wait until your 2016 filing date to get the deduction.</p>
<h2>3. Replace Office Equipment and Furnishings</h2>
<p>Setting up that home office? Breaking loose from your broker’s office? Setting up your own brokerage? Buy that stuff and put it into service before the end of the year and you can take an immediate deduction under Section 179.</p>
<p>Wait until next year and it’s too late, as you’ll have to wait until 2016’s filing before you can claim a deduction. But you can deduct the cost of furnishings, office equipment and other tangible property for your real estate business in 2015 for anything you purchase and use prior to December 31<sup>st</sup>. This is true even if you didn’t pay cash for the furnishings and equipment.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Remember that there is an overall limit of $25,000 on all Section 179 deductions for 2014 and 2015, until Congress changes the law. This is much lower than the $500,000 available in previous years.</p>
<h2>4. Pay Professional and Membership Dues and Subscriptions</h2>
<p>That’s a tax deductible expense. Pay them before year end and you can deduct them on this year’s taxes. <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/membership/dues-information">Here is the information for 2014 and 2015 dues and assessments for the National Realtors® Association</a>.</p>
<p>Now is the time to commit funds to other subscriptions as well, such as research and sales journals, sales training, periodicals such as the Wall Street Journal, and the like.</p>
<h2>5. Start a Retirement Plan</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/real-estate-retirement-plan-300x200.jpg" alt="starting a retirement plan can give real estate agents large tax deductions" title="real estate retirement plan" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-43901" />Even if you’re self-employed, you can still open up a retirement plan over and above an IRA or a Roth IRA. Options include a Simplified Employee Pension plan (SEP IRA) or a solo 401(k) plan. Both options allow you to set aside significant amounts of money – potentially up to $53,000 or 25 percent of compensation for owner-operators of corporations (20 percent for self-employed individuals), whichever is greater – for retirement.</p>
<p>There may be some costs to establish these plans, but if it’s a new plan, you may be able to claim a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/retirement/04/031704.asp">tax credit</a> worth 50 percent of the first $1,000 in setup costs in each of the first three years.</p>
<p>For SEP IRAs, you have until your filing deadline to contribute and still get a tax deduction for this year; but for 401(k)s, you must make your employee contributions prior to the end of the year.</p>
<h2>6. Commit Marketing and Advertising Money</h2>
<p>You can sign forward contracts for advertising and marketing services now to secure an immediate tax deduction for tax year 2014, even if you don’t actually receive the services until next year. This goes for advertising, printing, website development and other business and marketing expenses.</p>
<h2>7. Book Professional Travel</h2>
<p>The 2015 Real Estate Conference and Expo is in San Diego, Calif., on November 13-16. Sure, it’s tough to book out that far. But the <a href="https://www.tsnn.com/events/recon-global-retail-real-estate-convention">RECon Global Retail Real Estate Convention</a> is in Las Vegas on May 17-20, for you folks in commercial real estate and shopping centers. By committing the travel money this year, you secure your deduction for this year, as well. Otherwise you’ll have to wait until you file in 2016 before you claim the deduction.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>I can’t quite place my finger on it, but I’m having suspicions that my husband is secretly pursuing a real estate career. Am I being crazy? – Befuddled in Boise</em></p>
<p>We get this question – and others along the same lines – all the time. It’s time we address the issue of real estate agents in our communities head on.</p>
<h2>How to Identify a Real Estate Agent</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-43221" title="real estate agent couple" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/married-to-a-real-estate-agent-300x225.jpg" alt="How you know you're married to a real estate agent" width="300" height="225" />Real estate agents are all around you. They are your neighbors, your cousins, your brothers and sisters. Chances are good that a real estate agent sold you your house or manages your apartment complex. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, at any given time, there are <a href="http://www.bls.gov/ooh/sales/real-estate-brokers-and-sales-agents.htm">422,000 real estate agents living among us</a>. Their kids go to school with your kids. They may be sitting next to you at a football game. A few of them are even able to keep up the appearance of normalcy.</p>
<p>Scientists aren’t sure where real estate agents come from, though most are easy to spot. They send signals to each other by wearing small tokens of real estate agentism called “nametags” on their coats. These tokens not only communicate to potential clients what to call them, but with other signifiers, such as distinctively-colored overcoats, may indicate tribal affiliation and status – much in the same way a silverback indicates the status of a gorilla.</p>
<p>Some agents do not operate openly, however. Instead, they maintain “day jobs” during the week while sneaking off to “networking functions” at night, under the cover of darkness, and to “open houses” on the weekends, where they engage in elaborate rituals in an effort to find clients, listings and other like-minded people.</p>
<h2>10 Signs Your Spouse Is an Agent</h2>
<p>Could you be married to a real estate agent? Here are the top ten signs you have a real estate agent in the home.</p>
<p><strong>1. </strong>Dinner dates start with “What are you looking for in a restaurant today?”</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong>Hoarding strange business cards.</p>
<p><strong>3. </strong>Unexplained signage piling up in the garage – and, very rarely, at locations your spouse may refer to as “listings.”</p>
<p><strong>4. </strong>Frequent evening absences at “networking events,” “Toastmasters,” the “Rotary Club”, and with other associations.</p>
<p><strong>5. </strong>The suspected party returns all voicemails except for yours.</p>
<p><strong>6. </strong>Continually using “showings” and “open houses” as an excuse to avoid weekend chores.</p>
<p><strong>7. </strong>Unexplained cheesy glam photos.</p>
<p><strong>8. </strong>You own a car your children are not allowed to ride in.</p>
<p><strong>9. </strong>There are six gold blazers in the closet and he still can’t figure out what to wear.</p>
<p><strong>10.</strong> Describes your family to complete strangers as &#8220;a four bedroom in a neighborhood with great schools and outstanding curb appeal.&#8221;</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/10-signs-youre-married-to-a-real-estate-agent/">10 Signs You’re Married to a Real Estate Agent</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Markets go up; markets go down. But when all is said and done, when the fat lady has sung, and it’s all over save for probate lawyers picking over the remains, it is better to be an owner than a renter.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/buying-vs-renting-300x200.jpg" alt="tell buyer prospects that buying is still less expensive than renting" title="renting vs. buying" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-42911" />While this isn’t exactly counterintuitive, the numbers show that the long-term benefits of owning win out over time. That’s the latest word from Trulia&#8217;s chief economist, Jed Kolko, whose intrepid team of number crunchers just released their <a href="https://www.trulia.com/research/">quarterly cost of renting vs. ownership findings.</a></p>
<p>When the costs of borrowing are low, the difference isn’t even close. Owning, in the long run, is a walloping 38 percent cheaper than renting nationwide.</p>
<p>This could explain why some big hedge funds have been eager to back up the truck and dump cash into the housing market in recent years, buying up hundreds of homes at a time. With a 38 percent pretax profit margin baked into the cake, they’d be crazy not to – and it may have made sense for them to borrow at advantageous interest rates to be able to buy more. This isn’t dumb money we’re talking about. This is smart, institutional money, managed by professionals. If the big sharks are feeding, it’s not because there’s no blood in the water.</p>
<p>Here are the specifics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buying beats renting in all 100 of the largest metro areas studied. In 99 of them, the difference was at least 20 percent. The one outlier was Honolulu, where buying was only 17 percent cheaper than renting. Still not bad.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Mortgage rates would have to rise to 6 percent or more to make buying cheaper than renting in Honolulu. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate hasn’t been that high since 2008.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Detroit is a steal by this measure. It’s 63 percent cheaper to own than to rent in that troubled city.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The case for ownership over renting is strongest in Southern and Midwestern states. Owners had less of an advantage in California and New York.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>On average, mortgage rates would have to hit 8.9 percent for the costs of ownership to catch up with renting.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Where Buying Makes the Most and Least Sense</h2>
<p>The cities with the biggest advantage to owners, in terms of the spread between ownership and renting costs, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Detroit, MI &#8211; 63%</li>
<li>Gary, IN &#8211; 61%</li>
<li>Akron, OH &#8211; 58%</li>
<li>Toledo, OH &#8211; 58%</li>
<li>Cleveland, OH &#8211; 58%</li>
<li>Kansas City, MO-KS &#8211; 55%</li>
<li>Memphis, TN-MS-AR &#8211; 54%</li>
<li>Grand Rapids, MI &#8211; 54%</li>
<li>New Orleans, LA &#8211; 54%</li>
<li>Birmingham, AL &#8211; 54%</li>
</ol>
<p>The ten markets where the margin between the costs of ownership and renting were narrowest are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Honolulu, HI &#8211; 17%</li>
<li>Orange County, CA &#8211; 22%</li>
<li>San Jose, CA &#8211; 23%</li>
<li>New York, NY-NJ &#8211; 24%</li>
<li>San Francisco, CA &#8211; 25%</li>
<li>Los Angeles, CA &#8211; 26%</li>
<li>San Diego, CA &#8211; 26%</li>
<li>Sacramento, CA &#8211; 26%</li>
<li>Ventura County, CA &#8211; 28%</li>
<li>Austin, TX &#8211; 30%</li>
</ol>
<h2>A Look at the Methodology</h2>
<p>In calculating these numbers, the Trulia researchers used the following assumptions: Owners put down 20 percent in cash and financed the rest via a 30-year mortgage at the prevailing average rate of 4.3 percent. The model also assumed tax deductions of 25 percent (which I am not quite sold on).</p>
<p>Obviously, these figures wouldn’t represent the results a real estate investor would get, because investors don’t get the benefit of subsidized loan programs like the FHA and VA loans. And they generally have to pay higher interest rates.</p>
<p>Trulia found the best results for homeowners went to those who financed using a 15-year mortgage, rather than a 30-year mortgage – beating even the all-cash buyer. Trulia credits the higher fraction of payments going to pay down the principal and the faster buildup of equity.</p>
<p>A theoretical owner who bought with a 3.5 percent down payment using a FHA loan did not fare as well. In fact, by their calculations, it was actually more expensive to own in Honolulu with a 3.5 percent down, 30-year mortgage, than it was to rent. This goes to show: Costs of carry <em>count.</em></p>
<p>A bit more on the methodology: The researchers assumed a 3.5 percent rate of return on capital that is not invested in property. In other words, they value the “opportunity cost” at 3.5 percent. This is the theoretical number an investor can expect to get on whatever he doesn’t tie up in home equity. If you think you can do better, then your opportunity costs increase, and that means it is more expensive to pay down a mortgage. But be careful: The market battlefields are littered with the corpses of investors who thought they could do better than the risk-free rate – much less double it.</p>
<p>Maintenance and other ownership costs were calculated as follows: Annual renovation and maintenance costs were assumed to be 1 percent of the home’s value.  Annual insurance costs were set at 0.46 percent of the home’s value. Monthly utilities were set at $100/month in excess of what renters typically pay, and property taxes at the average metro property tax rate.</p>
<h2>Boiling It Down for Buyers</h2>
<p>Want to see how the numbers work in your area, or break them down for buyers? Trulia has a couple of interactive tools to help you do just that. Spend some time looking at the <a href="https://www.trulia.com/research/">Rent vs. Buy interactive map</a> and the <a href="https://www.trulia.com/blog/tech/rent-vs-buy/>Rent or Buy Calculator.</a></p>
<p>The true costs of ownership may well be somewhat higher than what is represented here. For example, I haven’t met an owner who regretted setting aside more than 1 percent of their home’s value per year for repairs and renovations, in the long run.</p>
<p>But if you’re looking for some data to help you move a prospective buyer into the owner column, this is a great resource – especially if you can get your prospect to play with the tools themselves! It’s one thing to hear it from you – it’s another when they are punching in the data on their own.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/tell-prospective-buyers-owning-is-38-percent-cheaper-than-renting/">Tell Prospective Buyers: Owning Is 38 Percent Cheaper Than Renting</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>
