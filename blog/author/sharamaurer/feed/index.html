<p><strong><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-60932 alignright" src="http://www.marketleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2022-HWTech100-RealEstate-Black-01-300x84.png" alt="" width="300" height="84" /><br />
MARCH 3, 2022 BELLEVUE, WASH:</strong> HousingWire has announced the 2022 Tech100 honorees, recognizing the most innovative technology companies in the real estate industry.</p>
<p>The Tech100 is the only program in the real estate industry that highlights technology innovation and recognizes companies that continuously raise the bar. Outlining the most innovative and impactful organizations that provide solutions to the challenges that real estate professionals face every day, the Tech100 grows more competitive every year as the demand for technology in the industry continues to progress.</p>
<p>“This year’s list of Tech100 honorees proves once again that innovation within housing is vital in differentiating the organizations who will thrive and those who will be left behind,” said Clayton Collins, CEO of HW Media. “This list spotlights the innovators that are making the housing sector better and more sustainable by increasing efficiency, improving experiences and bringing elasticity and improvements to age-old processes.”</p>
<p>“Residential real estate has seen massive change the past few years, from accelerated technology adoption and innovation to the forced digitization in a traditionally belly-to-belly business, and I’m proud of the remarkable amount of work the Market Leader team has done to bring value to our agents and the clients they serve,” said Robert Vickers, General Manager at Market Leader. “As true technology partners, we’ve made it our mission to internalize the voice of our customer to provide solutions that help them drive meaningful connections and deliver exceptional experiences, as demonstrated by the recognition here.”</p>
<p>Vickers was also named a <a href="https://www.rismedia.com/newsmaker/robert-vickers-2022-2/">Futurist</a> in RISMedia’s 2022 Newsmakers, recognized for his contributions to the real estate industry as a leader of change and driver of innovation.</p>

<p>June 3, 2021</p>
<p>BELLEVUE, WA: Market Leader, a leading provider of sales and marketing solutions in the real estate industry, today announced the launch of Facebook Leads. Available exclusively to Market Leader customers, Facebook Leads allows real estate professionals to get in front of Facebook’s 258 million active monthly users across the U.S. and Canada without having to build or manage advertising campaigns.</p>
<p>Facebook Leads leverages Market Leader’s team of advertising experts to build and optimize targeted Facebook campaigns and generate leads for customers, alleviating the challenges associated with Facebook’s complex Ads Manager platform. Market Leader’s advertising team has decades of experience running high volumes of ads across multiple platforms, generating powerful insights and optimization that benefits customers.</p>
<p>Agents remain in complete control of their budget and target markets, and can adjust their spend monthly as needs change. No contract is required to sign up.</p>
<p>Market Leader eliminates the largest barrier to advertising on Facebook today by allowing customers who do not have Facebook accounts to take advantage of Facebook Leads.</p>
<p>“Getting real estate agents in front of consumers looking to buy or sell a home has been at the core of what we do for over 20 years,” said Robert Vickers, General Manager of Market Leader. “Facebook Leads is another way for us to help our customers grow their sphere and capture leads, while removing the challenges that traditionally accompany Facebook advertising. We’re excited to provide our customers the benefits of social media advertising, without having to navigate the complexities of managing an additional platform or optimizing campaigns.”</p>
<p>“Facebook Leads by Market Leader automatically markets my listings as soon as they hit the MLS and gets me in front of home buyers and sellers in my area,” said Elizabeth Avery, RE/MAX Northwest REALTORS®, “I love that it feeds leads directly into my CRM and has taken the pain of managing ads off my plate, but gives me complete control over my monthly budget.”</p>
<p>With one of the largest IDX footprints across North America, Market Leader uses existing MLS integrations to automatically create and adjust ads for both active and recently sold listings as agents get a new listing or sale, generating high volumes of hyper-targeted impressions on Facebook’s network of 258 million users. Additionally, home buying and selling guides, developed in partnership with top-producing agents, are used to attract buyers and sellers in target areas, optimized based on consumer behavior to deliver customers the most impressions to grow their sphere.</p>
<p>Market Leader customers simply select their budget and target cities for Facebook Leads directly from their Market Leader system to get started.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Five actionable insights to heed today as you navigate a new normal. </span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feelings of panic, hesitation, and fear pervaded the real estate industry through most of the spring selling season. Now that the dust has settled and markets are rebounding nationwide, summer selling season is upon us and it’s time to kick your business into gear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We sat down (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">virtually</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">) with Aubie Pouncey – a powerhouse agent and team leader serving the greater Seattle area – to discuss how tech will continue to shape our industry, the data that drives it, and how you can leverage both to have the right conversations, and dominate your market in today’s new normal.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Technology is here to stay.</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The real estate industry has long struggled to adopt technology and if there’s one glaring effect the pandemic has had on industries worldwide is the acceleration of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">technology adoption. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology will continue to drive the real estate industry, post-pandemic. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumers were already interacting with the market digitally, leaning on agents to facilitate negotiations and the transaction itself; agents who struggled to adopt (and adapt) before can now lean into technology to be a bigger part of the consumer experience. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aubie says: Consider an agent whose largest source of business was open houses. All of their eggs were in one basket, and now they can&#8217;t get in front of people. </span></h3>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s an agent’s job to take things digital faster than their competitors and find ways to provide value in new mediums. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Today&#8217;s consumer is the same, but different.</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumer behavior has been changing for decades. Despite a lot of agents who, pre-pandemic, were hanging on to the idea of real estate being a belly-to-belly industry, it just isn’t anymore. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pre-pandemic, consumers already preferred a more digital experience. They are empowered and can browse homes online and conduct their own research. Today, those agents who have been slow to understand changing consumer expectations are forced to adapt and we think it will serve them well. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aubie says: Open all doors of communication and see which one they walk back through.</span></h3>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Call, text and email any new leads and let them interact with you on their terms. Give them options and let them know you are always there. No pressure is key. It is about giving them options and doors to walk through. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. When you make it about you, you lose.</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don&#8217;t let your own insecurity ruin a deal. Provide resources and value. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can&#8217;t force someone into the market, but you can provide them with resources and information that helps them make the best decisions for can themselves. If they don&#8217;t end up working with you, but you provided them with value, they&#8217;ll remember that down the road &#8211; whether their situation changes and they become ready to work with an agent or if they cross paths with someone looking to buy or sell. The seeds you sow today can be harvested for years to come. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aubie says: It&#8217;s about the model and the process.</span></h3>
</blockquote>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Let the numbers tell the story.</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is driving the market? What is driving YOUR market? People care about how things acutely affect them. It’s not about the overall market, it&#8217;s about THEIR market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Become the local economist and share market data as it relates to them. Are you a buyers agent? What does the data in your market say about new listings and mortgage rates? Are you a listing agent? What does the data say about buyer activity and how record low mortgage rates are creating an increased demand? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use data to tell your market’s story as it relates to your audience. Distill the numbers in a way that both makes sense and eases concerns. Note: y</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ou’ve got to understand the data so you can share it. Get comfortable with it and spend time understanding it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don&#8217;t underestimate how easy it is to access data. Google, local REALTORS associations, MLSs and your brokerage are all great resources. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. The new world has its sights set on rural. </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One glaring impact the pandemic has had across the country: people no longer want to be in densely populated areas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People with underlying health issues and compromised immune systems are relocating entirely. Large populations of people living in urban areas are now remote, free to live and work from anywhere. People who have options will exercise them.</span></p>
<p>While the world starts to settle into our new, foreseeable normal, agents have a massive opportunity to step up and capitalize on some of the disruption caused a few short months ago.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aubie says: Pivot, find the market of the minute and connect with those people who need resources.</span></h3>
</blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The majority of the country is approaching its third month of a new, post-pandemic normal. Some states are easing shelter-in-place (SIP) orders, while others are extending and restricting even further.</p>
<p>Google searches for “homes for sale” fell over 30% from February to March in the wake of the coronavirus’ entrance to the U.S., the World Health Organization declaring a global pandemic, and inaugural SIP orders. Along with consumer home-search behavior declining, the stock market plummeted and the Federal Reserve slashed mortgage rates in an attempt to stimulate investor activity.</p>
<p>Pre-pandemic consumer search volume for the Real Estate category in 2020 peaked in mid-February at 81 points before falling 46% to 44 points in mid-March, as the effects of COVID began to take a toll.</p>
<p>Understandably, the real estate industry was shaken. Those who witnessed the Great Recession of 2008 are likely plagued by similar encounters with plummeting stocks, threats of corporate bankruptcy and economic collapse. No one could be sure what the future held; whether the spring 2020 seller’s market was lost or if activity would cease entirely.</p>
<p>Despite an uncertain economic outlook, volatile stock market, and over <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf">38 million</a>Americans filing for unemployment benefits in the past nine weeks, the real estate market has already begun to recover.</p>
<p>Consumer search volume for “homes for sale” has now rebounded to <i>above</i> pre-COVID levels. As of May 17th, U.S. search activity in the Real Estate category was continuing to rise and search volume for “homes for sale” has hit 100 points, the highest monthly search volume it’s ever been.</p>
<div id="attachment_58853" style="width: 845px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-58853" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-58853 size-full" src="https://www.marketleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GT20200521-Consumer-Search-Volume-Index.png" alt="Google Trends Real Estate Search Volume COVID" width="835" height="503" /><p id="caption-attachment-58853" class="wp-caption-text">Data source: Google Trends</p></div>
<p>Despite a fast-recovering market, agent activity is not rebounding as quickly as consumer search volume and is still down 12-15% from pre-COVID levels.</p>
<p>There is <a href="/blog/real-estate-opportunities-to-seize-during-the-pandemic/">opportunity to be seized</a>.</p>
<p>We surveyed thousands of agents last month to understand what successes they were seeing, what they were doing to engage their markets. We learned a lot. The biggest takeaway from survey responses was this:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>The only agents who aren’t seeing any success right now are those doing nothing.</h3>
</blockquote>
<p><b>To recap, here’s what we learned</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">51% of agents are making care calls regularly and of those agents, 46% are generating new business.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">25% of agents are leveraging social media to stay in touch with their sphere and continue to market their listings; 35% of which are generating new business.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Only 5% of agents are investing in paid <a href="/products/real-estate-leads/">lead generation</a> services, but 75% of them are generating new business.</li>
</ul>
<p>Albeit cautiously, the real estate industry and markets across the country are rebounding. There are less active agents and those who are still active are less productive. The need for consumers to buy and sell real estate is not dependent on your willingness to show up. Transactions will close whether with you or your competition.</p>
<p>The real estate industry is resilient. Those who adapt and innovate to serve their clients in a shifting market are going to reap the rewards long far into a post-pandemic world.</p>
<p>We’ll continue to publish updated information, trends and resources as situations evolve. If you’ve got any successes, strategies or just positive stories to share as they relate to the global environment today – please share! We’d love to feature you and share your story with the industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are two camps of real estate agents today: those sleeping on their business, waiting for the storm to pass, and those who are doubling down, capitalizing on opportunities the current market is presenting.</p>
<p>Over the past month, we’ve been tapping our networks to find out what people’s challenges are, what’s working for them, what’s not, and what agents are seeing in local markets across the country.</p>
<p>It comes as no surprise that the majority of agents and Market Leader customers we’ve spoken to have not experienced dramatic losses. The common thread that seems to tie them all together?</p>
<p><strong>Mindset. </strong></p>
<p>Getting through the COVID crisis with your mind, health, and business in tact comes down to mindset. In life, just as in business, situations like the very one we are in builds resilience and, if you’re approaching it right, presents opportunity.</p>
<p>There is opportunity to grow as others exit the business.</p>
<p>There is opportunity to position yourself as an expert and a resource during a time when consumers need guidance most. “The worse things get, the more value you can add,” <a href="http://justlistedsnohomish.com">Aubie Pouncey</a> of KW Pacific NW put it plainly. “It’s a real estate agent’s job to usher people through challenging times.”</p>
<p>The COVID crisis might have much of the world confined, but it is still turning. The pandemic won’t stop people from needing to buy or sell a home.</p>
<h4>People move out of necessity because of:</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">• Death<br />
• Divorce<br />
• Illness<br />
• Relocation<br />
• Financial hardship<br />
• Right-sizing</p>
<p>And that’s just the short list. Those affected by life events still need to move, and they need the guidance of an agent now more than ever.</p>
<h4>There is opportunity to build out a pipeline now that will:</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Keep your business moving </strong></li>
<li><strong>Boom on the other side of the pandemic</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The reality is buyers and sellers in the market right now are active and, while there might be less of them, they are more serious. You might have to work harder, but the opportunity is there.</p>
<p>And, for those who may have decided to pause their search or pull their listing, continuing to engage with them and make yourself available as a resource during this time will secure their business in the future.</p>
<h3>Your competition is leaving the business.</h3>
<p>Redfin laid of 41% of its agents. Compass laid off over 350 agents. Zillow halted its iBuyer program.<br />
What does this mean for you? A large percentage of your competition is not active in the business and there is market share to be had.</p>
<p>Between the Redfin and Compass layoffs, there are 1700 agents exiting the business right now.</p>
<p>That is opportunity.</p>
<p>iBuyers bought over 53,000 homes in 2019. That’s over 4,400 homes a month. Zillow Offers bought over 1200 properties in the Phoenix area alone last year. That’s 100 properties per month in one market.</p>
<p>Zillow, Redfin, and Opendoor all suspended homebuying in March.</p>
<p>That is opportunity.</p>
<h3>People are still buying homes.</h3>
<p>While some numbers might be down year-over-year, there is still movement markets across the country.</p>
<p>According to NAR, 19% of buyers are still actively searching and determined to buy when they find the right property and 53% are still searching and keeping an eye on the market, but not as actively. And of those still searching, 34% are looking to purchase in the next six months. Only 28% of buyers in the market have decided to stop their search.</p>
<p>That is opportunity.</p>
<h3>People are still selling homes.</h3>
<p>Despite the pandemic, people are still listing &#8211; <em>and selling</em> &#8211; their homes. The process might look different depending on your market and shelter-in-place orders in your state, but transactions are closing.</p>
<p>One Bremerton, WA homeowner <a href="https://www.kitsapsun.com/story/news/2020/04/14/essential-workers-kitsap-real-estate-housing-market-coronavirus-pandemic/2985349001/">listed</a> her home for sale on April 8th, a Wednesday, and accepted one out of eight offers over the following weekend.</p>
<p>JoAnn Bailey, Broker at <a href="https://www.joannbailey.com/">Real Estate Services</a> in Idaho, closed the biggest deal of her career, curbside, on April 6th &#8211; sharing a post on Facebook that went viral and inspired thousands and started the hashtag, “#curbsideclosings.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/92076187_2575809502739800_5221799965503782912_o.jpg?_nc_cat=106&amp;_nc_sid=110474&amp;_nc_oc=AQkMJ0E3f-na1dJXTHHIH-gboBFahYPXrp4u0byEz9kKLBpn98qFxpZAreifNzam4_nMx2oA7c1fPN9KHs9BojSg&amp;_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&amp;oh=2a10e271bd7fc3e1a21d4baa4ff0cc06&amp;oe=5EBDB252" width="1517" height="1517" /></p>
<p>There is still a great deal of opportunity to be seized.</p>
<p>Engage your sphere, make yourself available as a resource, position yourself as a trusted expert and guide your community through uncertainty.</p>
