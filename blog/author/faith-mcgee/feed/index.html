										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11341" title="Competing for Real Estate Leads" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Fotolia_50977577_XS-300x199.jpg" alt="Some agents might try to steal real estate leads, but there are steps you can take to protect your prospects" width="300" height="199" />It’s a common practice in real estate to try to generate leads from a competitor already doing a good volume of business. The easiest way to steal leads is to look at a competitor’s shortcomings and create a marketing plan based on their shortfalls.</p>
<p>Easy Targets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Agents who don’t focus on a target market.</li>
<li>Agents lacking a comprehensive website.</li>
<li>Agents without a lead management system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lack of drive will also cost you leads. Don’t become complacent with your marketing plan &#8211; there’s always someone around the corner creating a strategy that tries to address your inadequacies.</p>
<h2>Target Market</h2>
<p>Casting a large net into a sea of leads seems like a good idea. But potential leads don’t want to do business with an agent who doesn’t specialize in a specific field. Without a target market, you will look like a generic agent.</p>
<p>People want to do business with agents who know who their clients are and what they want. When you look at it from the client’s perspective, it makes sense. They don’t want to waste time working with an agent who doesn’t understand their needs. Stand out from the rest by becoming an expert in your field. Dustin Russell, manager of acquisition marketing at Market Leader, offers this advice:</p>
<p>“Make sure you aren&#8217;t advertising alongside other agents. A site that places you next to one, two, or three other agents doesn&#8217;t provide exclusivity. You may get a lead here and there, but you aren&#8217;t positioned as the only expert in your area.”</p>
<p>Once you have set your sights on a specific demographic &#8211; families, first-time buyers, seniors, etc. &#8211; design a marketing plan that appeals to them. For example, techies looking for a new home in an urban area will do most of their research online. Create a strong presence on social media sites and develop an informative website to attract this market.</p>
<h2>Comprehensive Website</h2>
<p>Can an online consumer conduct research on your website? Is the information on your site easily accessible? “Today, agents need a single location that they can send their leads to, and usually that&#8217;s their branded website,” says Russell. “This website should include all the things a prospective homebuyer might want in their research process, including listings, neighborhood stats, mortgage rates, etc.,” he concludes. If an online customer can’t find the information they need or are simply directed to an MLS site, they will leave your website.</p>
<h2>Website Must Haves</h2>
<ul>
<li>A landing page with your contact information.</li>
<li>High-resolution property photos with information.</li>
<li>A bio about the real estate agent.</li>
<li>Rich content (articles and blogs showcasing your expertise in a field).</li>
<li>Easy to find navigation tabs.</li>
<li>Optimized website content with keywords for search engines.</li>
</ul>
<p>While many agents expand on this list, providing additional bells and whistles on their websites, such as videos, you must at least have the basics. Any holes in your website will send a lead running to another agent. Make sure that your website meets the needs of your target market.</p>
<h2>Lead Management System</h2>
<p>A lead management system helps you retain your leads before they get stolen from someone else. All the money that has gone into generating your leads (marketing, technology, etc.) will go to waste if you can’t convert the lead into a client. There are numerous lead generation systems out there for real estate agents. The most basic ones will help you organize your leads, capture your lead’s contact information, alert you when a lead is trying to contact you, send out auto-responses, and email leads with information based on their searches.</p>
<p>A lead may not be ready to become a client. By using a lead management system, you are able to stay in the forefront of their mind until they are ready to buy or sell a property.</p>
<p>Ways of keeping contact include newsletters, blogs, articles and emails. You can keep your leads engaged by providing them with a stream of relevant information. To prevent other agents from muscling in on your leads, continually monitor your marketing campaign and make improvements as needed.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/how-to-keep-other-agents-from-stealing-your-leads/">How to Keep Other Agents From Stealing Your Leads</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you promote your real estate business to everyone, you’ll wind up with a very unfocused marketing campaign. Creating a brand that appeals to everyone is entirely too overwhelming and not feasible. To sell your product (homes) or services (ability to sell properties), you must know your customer. </p>
<p>Identifying your target market is more difficult than it sounds. You must give yourself some time for self-reflection. What do you want your niche to be? What is your expertise? Knowing your strengths help when determining what demographic to target.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Defining Your Target Market</h2>
<p>What criteria should you use when defining your target market? Peter Johnson, National Vice President of Sales and Marketing for YourDox, suggests using geographic, economic and social criteria to narrow down your potential clientele. “Defining a target market can be a key to success for those who do it well; a Realtor® or broker may market themselves specifically to luxury properties, for example, or to families with young children, and gear their marketing efforts and materials to their desired clientele,” says Johnson.</p>
<p>Avoid wasting time by coming up with a wish list of clients. Research what types of properties people are buying or selling in your geographic region.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Research</h2>
<p>You can never know too much about the real estate market in your area. In fact, research is absolutely essential for finding your niche. </p>
<p>“I did some research to figure out where most of the condo transactions were happening in the areas near my home. There aren&#8217;t many single-family homes in the area, so I had already decided condos would be the focus,” says Jon Sterling, sales associate at Climb Real Estate Group. </p>
<p>Sterling decided that he would specialize in selling homes in an up-and-coming neighborhood in San Francisco called SOMA (South of Market), because the transaction volume was higher compared to other parts of the city.</p>
<p>In some extreme cases, you will have to tailor your target market to the most popular ideology around you. Mark Warden, owner of <a href="https://www.porcupinerealestate.com/">Porcupine Real Estate</a>, specializes as a buyer&#8217;s agent in New Hampshire and targets people relocating to the state with Free State Project. “My clients are all libertarian-leaning and thus typically want property with very few zoning restrictions (certainly not CC&amp;Rs), lower property taxes, and a &#8216;less-is-more&#8217; small town government,” says Warden. Once you’ve figured out your target market, you are ready to create a focused marketing plan.</p>

<strong>Identifying your target market is just one step in the process of developing a good marketing plan. <a href="#download" style="color: #F95515;">Get our “2023 Real Estate Marketing Plan”</a> to learn everything else that you need to know!</strong>
</div>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Creating a Marketing Plan</h2>
<p>Your target market will dictate how you approach planning marketing strategies. Ben Fisher, real estate agent at <a href="https://www.deervalleyhomesforsale.com/">Summit Sotheby’s International Realty</a>, targets out-of-state vacation home and condo owners. He’s found that a combination of monthly direct mail and online advertising consistently reaches the homebuyers and sellers he’s looking for. “Instead of a broad campaign reaching the masses with a basic sales proposition, we can target ourselves as leaders in selling and representing buyers purchasing vacation property throughout the area,” says Fisher.</p>
<p>Like most things in marketing, there will be some trial and error before you find the right marketing combination that reaches your target market. However, any type of marketing plan or campaign you implement must showcase how well you know your target market. Blogs, articles, website content, direct mail and newsletters must demonstrate your expertise in a particular field. “I have a blog devoted to the condo market in the area. I share information on new developments, condos for sale, and market statistics in SOMA. Whenever I talk to clients and potential clients about my business, I make it clear that I focus on SOMA condos,” says Jon Sterling.</p>
<p>If you are rolling out a new marketing campaign, you should also keep tabs on how well it’s doing.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Measuring Success</h2>
<p>There are numerous ways that you can measure how successful you are at creating a target market:</p>
<ul>
<li>An increase in website traffic.</li>
<li>A higher click-through rate from social media networks to your website.</li>
<li>A larger client base.</li>
<li>Brand awareness throughout your region.</li>
<li>Closing more homes or adding more listings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your goal doesn’t need to be as large as doubling your revenue in a year. Some real estate agents are happy with satisfied clients. “The satisfaction of my clients is how I keep score because it drives market share. Real estate is a referral-based business, and if my clients are happy, they will refer me more business. My market share grows as an extension of me keeping my clients happy, which feels good,” says Jon Sterling. It’s like the old adage, “If you build it, they will come.”</p>
<p>Building a focused marketing campaign that is tailor-made for your target market will help you increase revenue. “Focusing on this smaller niche has led to increased response rates to our marketing efforts as well as increased sales,” says Ben Fisher.</p>
<p>If you’ve found that your target market is too small, all is not lost. You may find that there are complementary audiences that can benefit from your expertise. For example, those selling loft properties may be able to widen their audience to condo or apartment buyers. Be flexible, but don’t overextend your brand to accommodate too large of a client pool.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A strong brand identity is one of the most important building blocks for any real estate business. Think of it as your company’s foundation. In essence, your branding should help your clients see you as the solution to their problem. Likewise, companies such as Nike, Coca-Cola and Microsoft use names, logos, terms, designs and symbols to differentiate themselves from other businesses.</p>
<p>Strong brands do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a connection with a target market.</li>
<li>Build customer loyalty.</li>
<li>Substantiate credibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before you run out and spend money on advertising or implement a marketing campaign, it is essential that you establish your personal real estate branding. Without a substantial brand, you may not see a return on your investment.</p>
<h2>How to Identify Your Branding</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9931" title="Branding - How to Create and Promote Your Real Estate Brand" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Fotolia_41956081_XS-300x201.jpg" alt="Creating a strong brand for your real estate business will build trust with clients" width="300" height="201" />A brand is like a personality. What type of person would be interested in your company’s traits or services? According to real estate agent Mukul Lalchandani, “A real estate company has to understand who their core market is. Is it based on certain demographics, or based on the properties they are promoting?</p>
<p>For example, some agencies specialize on loft properties, so their branding is centered around this ideology, while others focus on luxury properties, so their brand tends to be more sophisticated and clean cut. Once a core market is discovered, then the agency should understand how to communicate to the target audience by using sensory tactics such as visual communications, smells, [and] sounds that promote the same message to their audience. It’s all about having one voice that connects properties to people.”</p>
<p>To identify your target market, pinpoint the specific type of client employing your services, the market your competitors are targeting, and who needs your services. Chances are that not everyone needs your services. What type of client would get the most out of your company? While it’s beneficial to start your real estate business with a strong brand, not everyone has the luxury of starting with a blank slate.</p>
<h2>When is it Time to Rebrand?</h2>
<p>It’s never too late to rebrand. According to Greg Maka, managing director of 24-7 Marketing LLC, “Rebranding is required when a company is not meeting its sales goals or does not see any growth. They are probably perceived as &#8220;like all the other real estate agencies.&#8221; When you determine what your brand (unique selling proposition) will be, you must promote everywhere.”</p>
<p>Altering your established brand is no small feat. Nonetheless, all real estate companies must be flexible enough to adjust with the times. “Creating a new brand identity keeps you fresh and relevant in the ever-changing marketplace. With the onset of technology and information, consumers want to connect with those that are up-to-date and understand the new way of doing business,” says Lalchandani. Look at rebranding as a chance to focus on your company’s vision and recreate yourself in a new light.</p>
<h2>How to Promote Your Branding</h2>
<p>Your brand identity must be at the very heart of every marketing campaign you implement. Every newsletter, email, Facebook post, “tweet,” blog and brochure must support your branding. Even the way you answer your phone should give customers a sense of what your company is about. Promoting your brand doesn’t have to be an overwhelming experience. “My promotion does not have to be wide scale or expensive, it is more about direct marketing, and only hits the people that I want to inform. I use online methods such as email newsletters, website and blogging. Offline methods include some direct mail pieces [and] promotions specific to certain buildings in Manhattan,” says Lalchandani.</p>
<p>To effectively promote your branding, you must write a creative brief that outlines the direction that you are taking your real estate business, the target market that you are pursuing, and your competitive positioning (how your real estate business differs from the competition). Keep your creative brief on hand. It will be one of the primary resources you use for all of your marketing.</p>
<h2>Measuring Your Brand’s Success</h2>
<p>Like everything in marketing, you should have a way of measuring success. “In today&#8217;s world, successful branding really is the result of continuous promotion of the same “unique” theme or selling proposition, utilizing as many tools as you can afford,” says Maka. Because you are running a company and not a free service, it comes down to your bottom line. However, other factors such as the quality of your customer base and listings help you determine how successful your branding is in the market place. If your customers and peers respect your brand, you are building a strong brand identity.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/promoting-your-brand-how-to-promote-you/">Promoting Your Brand – How to Promote You</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While a website must express a company’s brand, services and products (properties), it should also entertain the visitor up to a certain point. Boring, unprofessional and confusing websites make for bad storefronts for real estate businesses. It’s like walking into a store littered with products or lacking any employees. Generally, people will walk out and never return. Ineffective websites alienate customers, so it’s absolutely critical for real estate businesses to take an objective approach when designing or redesigning their website to enhance their customers’ experience.</p>
<h2>Who is Your Audience?</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-9581" title="create an engaging real estate website" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Fotolia_47753777_XS.jpg" alt="create an engaging real estate website" width="288" height="287" />You must figure out your target market or audience before you can create an engaging website. According to Christian K. Nordtømme, Creative Director at <a href="http://nextpage.no.">Next Page</a>, “Real estate brokers and agents have two audiences: sellers, who need to be convinced that they&#8217;ll get the best price possible for their treasured home, and buyers, who need to know they&#8217;re getting a great deal. The website needs to hit home with both audiences.”</p>
<p>Not every design or layout works for every customer. Likewise, your website should appeal to your target market. For instance, those selling modern designed properties will have a greater chance of customer engagement by choosing a website design that incorporates a streamlined, contemporary look. Create a website that mirrors the types of properties that you sell or your customer base.</p>
<h2>High Quality Photos</h2>
<p>Poor quality photos will not attract customers or keep them engaged.  According to Justin Hughes, co-founder of <a href="http://www.realtymogul.com">Reality Mogul</a>, “Quality photos will hook your visitors’ interest much more effectively than low-resolution or otherwise poor-quality photography. They will be much more likely to dive into the text when it is accompanied by high-quality imagery, and let&#8217;s face it, real estate metrics can be very bland.” Using high quality photos in some cases is easier said then done. Investing in a digital camera or hiring a photographer to shoot a home can make all the difference in the world when designing a visually pleasing website.</p>
<h2>Reduce Friction</h2>
<p>Requiring visitors to take a number of steps while going through your website is a good way to get them to leave. “Don&#8217;t require users to perform a bunch of actions in order to do the things they want. Each step or required action is a potential point where a user will drop off. If it is a pain to engage with your site, people will just move on because, at a certain point, it is no longer worth it to them. Allow them to do what they want with as little friction as possible and your engagement rates will soar.”</p>
<p>You wouldn’t want to visit someone who had you perform chores, fill out paperwork or reveal personal information. Don’t make your visitor work for information. Everything on your website should be a click away. Likewise, give people the ability to go back to the home page from every page. Visitors will not return of they are easily lost on your website.</p>
<h2>User Interface for Your Website</h2>
<p>Good user interface allows customers to easily complete tasks like signing up for a newsletter, viewing listings, reading website content or making selections. People have certain expectations about navigating on a website. Clearly designed categories and secondary links allow the user to access information. “Don&#8217;t try and reinvent the wheel with your UI. Unless you really nail it, you run the risk of breaking people&#8217;s expectations, and they will feel frustrated when trying to perform common actions in their usual way. Also, try not to overload [users] with choices. Keep things simple and make the most common actions obvious with higher-priority ordering in your UI.”</p>
<p>Design your website for the user and not for any aesthetic reasons. Navigate your own website from a user perspective to determine if any changes need to be made.</p>
<h2>Rewards</h2>
<p>Reward visitors for coming to your website. This doesn’t mean offering coupons or special offers. In fact, you can reward your customer with engaging content, high quality photos, easy access to pertinent information or gamification. “Gamification is a broad term used to describe any form of UX (user experience) where a user is rewarded for engagement. This can be as simple as profile badges for top contributors or giving points to users when they comment on posts,” says John Hughes.</p>
<p>You can also increase visitor engagement by responding to comments or questions. As many real estate businesses find, customers feel engaged when the website has been tailored and thoughtfully created for them. While promoting your brand is essential, engaging your customer will establish a strong bond that can lead to a quality customer base.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/how-to-keep-customers-engaged-on-your-website/">How to Keep Customers Engaged on Your Website</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9221" title="how to write engaging content for search engines" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Fotolia_40583339_XS-300x190.jpg" alt="how to write engaging content for search engines" width="300" height="190" />While most people understand that writing optimized content will raise their chances of ranking high on search engines, many people make the mistake of creating copy that is jam-packed with keywords or contains less-than-engaging material for their readers. According to Jill Whalen, CEO of High Rankings and co-founder of <a href="https://www.semne.org/">Search Engine Marketing New England</a>, “Real estate agents should be writing for the searcher at the other end of Google. That person who has a problem or a question or some sort of need that brought them to the search engine in the first place. The idea isn&#8217;t to try to please the search engine with your content but to provide the searcher with the information that they seek.”</p>
<p>Writing engaging optimized content is not something that is intuitive or started without any strategy. A clear marketing campaign is essential for both your short- and long-term SEO success.</p>
<h2>Choosing Keywords</h2>
<p>When keyword phrases are successfully used, they tell Google what the content or webpage is about so people can find that information. The term “keyword” is somewhat of a misnomer. People actually search for phrases rather than one word. For instance, searching for the word “home” would cause irrelevant websites to pop up. However, searching for the phrase “one-bedroom houses in Austin” will narrow down the list of websites. How does an agent choose keyword phrases? Here is Jill Whalen’s advice:</p>
<p>“You need to learn what it is that your target audience (presumably homebuyers) is looking for when they go to Google. There are, of course, obvious answers like ‘new homes in [city],’ ‘[city] real estate,’ etc., but all real estate sites are going to be targeting those keyword phrases. This makes for some pretty stiff competition. Not only are you competing with every other real estate agency in the area, you&#8217;re competing with the large all-encompassing real estate sites. Find some of the more obscure things that people want to know by checking out &#8220;question&#8221; sites such as Quora.com. A quick look at a real estate section reveals a whole slew of questions people have asked, such as, ‘Is buying a home still the best first investment?’ and ‘What are the best ways to increase the property value of your home?’ These questions become potential keyword phrases, or at least the ideas for new content on your real estate site that goes beyond the home listings themselves.”</p>
<p>Create a list of keyword phrases BEFORE writing content. Keep in mind that the list shouldn’t necessarily be more important than the quality of your content.</p>
<h2>Incorporating Keywords Into Your Content</h2>
<p>Forget jam-packing your content with keywords. “Keyword stuffing” makes content sound unnatural and can get you penalized by a search engine such as Google. Penalization may result in your website getting removed from the search engine’s index.</p>
<p>How does one incorporate keywords into content? “For long-tail keywords for, say, a blog that you&#8217;re writing in frequently, you don&#8217;t have to worry too much about incorporating specific keyword phrases. The words that you&#8217;re using naturally within the content make up an unlimited pool of long-tail keywords. While individually they will not bring a lot of traffic, once you have a lot of content on your site, you&#8217;ll start to see lots of search engine traffic for hundreds or even thousands of different keyword phrases. The idea is to continually put out great, unique information that your competitors aren&#8217;t offering. You can of course take this one step further by adding keyword-rich title tags, headlines and subheadings to your already written article as long as they make sense to what the article is about,” says Jill Whalen.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Title Tag</strong> &#8211; The title tag shows up in three key places. It is one of the most critical SEO elements that appears on the page. It shows up at the top of the browser chrome, in the search engine results page and as a link anchor text on external websites like social media sites. The best practice is to make the title tag less than 70 characters; otherwise, Google won’t show its entirety.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Headlines</strong> &#8211; Write a headline that describes the content. If you’ve written a blog about rehabbing a Victorian house, write a headline that includes words such as “renovation,” “Victorian,” “house” or “home” in the headline so people searching for those terms can find your blog.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subheadings</strong> &#8211; Subheadings must thematically connect to the headline. They must sum up the information on the page, so that someone can simply scan the page to get an idea of its contents.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What Makes Content Engaging?</h2>
<p>It’s easier to write boring content than it is to craft engaging material. Interesting, thoughtful information creates a connection with your target market. What else can engaging content do? “It appeals to the reader&#8217;s emotions. Content that addresses what real people with real problems need will be engaging to them. If the content is very much &#8220;we focused&#8221; (on the company itself) rather than &#8220;you focused&#8221; (on the reader) users won&#8217;t often go beyond the first paragraph. But if you can somehow make an emotional connection with that reader, they&#8217;ll stay engaged and want even more content from you. You&#8217;ve got to stress what&#8217;s in it for them at all times,” says Jill Whalen.</p>
<p>An easy way of figuring out if your content is engaging is to read it to someone else. Hearing the content read out loud and getting feedback will help you shape the information on your page so that it is engaging for the reader. Search engines will not tell you the exact algorithm that they use for ranking websites, but having engaging optimized content will always put you ahead of the game.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/how-to-write-engaging-content-for-search-engines/">How to Write Engaging Content for Search Engines</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These days it seems like everyone has a Twitter account. Politicians, celebrities, sports figures and companies have recognized the numerous opportunities that this information network provides. Real estate businesses use Twitter to connect to potential leads, promote their brands and sell homes. Because Twitter doesn’t require hours spent writing pages of content, you can devote 15 minutes a day to promote your real estate business and services. Before you start “tweeting,” it’s best to come up with a plan.</p>
<h2>What to Tweet</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9131" title="using twitter to sell homes" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Fotolia_47620707_XS-300x300.jpg" alt="using twitter to sell homes" width="300" height="300" />Just as easily as you can engage your target market with interesting tweets, you can also annoy and alienate your audience. According to Pete Deininger, Realtor® at <a href="https://www.thebrecklife.com/">Breckenridge Real Estate</a>, “The golden rule for businesses on social media is to never be salesy.” You want to offer your followers substance. According to Tierra Wilson, founder and CEO of New Media 4 Agents, “We don&#8217;t just put the Tweets out there and hope for the best.  We use multiple strategies to tweet home listings. One of the most effective is just to have fun. People love to see the inside of homes, so we use their natural voyeuristic tendencies to get them to take a peak. We tweet specific home features with links to images. For example,<em>’Cold outside! Wish you had this fireplace? For $250k you could. #interiors #realestate’</em> and we include a link to a single property website or IDX listing with pictures of the home.”</p>
<p>Come up with a strategy before sending out tweets. Are you selling specific types of properties such as commercial spaces? Are you just building up a following? What target market are you courting? Your answers to these questions will dictate what you tweet. It’s also important to keep in mind that not every tweet has to be about real estate.</p>
<h2>Tweeting Subjects</h2>
<p>People may not want to read a tweet about a home listing everyday. Change it up so they become more engaged. “Tweet creative, valuable content that provides entertainment or expertise about the area. This will bring people to your site. If they decide to purchase a home in the future, you will be top-of-mind for them to contact,” says Pete Deininger.</p>
<p>Pete Deininger’s List of Popular Tweeting Subjects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask fun and engaging questions. &#8220;What&#8217;s your all-time favorite holiday movie? Why?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Share local photos; &#8220;Who loves to play in powder!?&#8221; &#8211; a pic of the new snowfall from last night.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Share information about local events.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Tweet local insight (where to find inexpensive/quality rental ski equipment, best happy hour in town, ski parking tips, local hero stories, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>By tweeting questions, you engage your audience or create a two-way engagement channel, which will help build relationships. You can ask people about what they are doing for the weekend, if they’ve seen a new movie that came out, how they are dealing with the weather or if they have any holiday plans. Give back to your audience by asking questions and responding to their tweets.</p>
<h2>The Compose-Edit-Reply Schedule</h2>
<p>Create a tweeting schedule that you follow every day. The best time to tweet is anytime between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. Monday through Thursday, according to the data collected by the bookmarking service, Bitly. You can set an alarm on your phone that goes off every day to remind you. Compose a tweet to send out to your followers. Give yourself five minutes to write and five minutes to edit it down to fit the maximum allotment of 140 characters. Keep in mind that the length of your username will reduce the amount of characters you can use.  After you tweet, spend five minutes replying back to comments from past tweets. Take advantage of the dialogue your tweets are creating. Send thoughtful replies that designate you as a real thought leader in your field.</p>
<h2>Tracking Success</h2>
<p>Track your success by using a web analytic service. “If you have Google Analytics installed on your website, you will be able to measure how many visits you are acquiring from Twitter. You will also get a glimpse at what they are doing after they get to your site. You have the ability to set up &#8216;goals&#8217; in Google Analytics, and your goal could be to track the number of visits coming from Twitter that eventually land on a listing page or submit contact information,” says Pete Deininger. It’s important to be able to measure the success or failure of your social media campaigns in order to know what is working and what needs tweaking.</p>
<h2>Twitter Burnout</h2>
<p>Prevent Twitter burnout or writer’s block by making a list of all possible subjects that you can tweet about. Taking a look at other real estate agent’s tweets will also give you some ideas. You can also get creative. Some real estate businesses have experienced success by setting up Twitter profiles for properties. Experiment and see what works for you and your real estate business. Above everything else, commit to spending 15 minutes a day. Consistency is the name of the game in social media marketing.</p>
<p>What are your favorite subjects to tweet about? Tell us what aspects of your tweeting plan have &#8211; or have not &#8211; worked for your real estate business.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/using-twitter-to-sell-homes-in-just-15-minutes-a-day/">Using Twitter to Sell Homes in Just 15 Minutes a Day</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The list of social media networking sites, including Twitter, Facebook, Linkedin, Active Rain, and YouTube, could make your head spin. If the thought of starting and maintaining an actionable social media strategy seems overwhelming, it’s time to come up with a game plan. In the world of social media, you are either a player or sitting the sidelines. Writing a blog from time to time, creating a Facebook page that you rarely visit or tweeting every couple of weeks doesn’t keep you in the game. In fact, it shows that you are inconsistent. Go beyond just creating a presence.</p>
<h2>How to Get Started</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8711" title="social media strategies" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Fotolia_34233244_XS-300x198.jpg" alt="social media strategies" width="300" height="198" />Before you start creating accounts on every social media networking website under the sun, take some time to think about your target market. By focusing on a target market, you can create a consistent brand and focused social media strategy. “Determine your target market, because you will want to use the social media tool(s) where you will find your target market. … By establishing this, you will be more effective and efficient in your social media efforts,” says Sheryl Johnson, founder and CEO of BD-Pro Marketing Solutions.</p>
<p>A target market is who you think will buy a property or service from you. Create a list of characteristics that you think your customer base has—age, marital status, geographic location, occupation and hobbies to name a few. This list is referred to as a demographic profile. Use this demographic profile when creating your online presence.</p>
<h2>Following a Schedule</h2>
<p>Consistency is the name of the game, so don’t overextend yourself right off the bat. In fact, you need a schedule to stay on point. According to John-Henry Scherck, Digital Marketer for SEER Interactive, “I generally call these content calendars and with them I like to be consistent. It&#8217;s not about volume; consequently, it&#8217;s all about quality and consistency. If you can figure out a schedule that adds value to your followers and keeps them engaged, it doesn&#8217;t matter if you make it a weekly event (like a new blog post), a daily event (like Facebook updates), or multiple updates a day (via Twitter). As long as it&#8217;s consistent and meaningful, you should be fine.”</p>
<p>Choose one social media networking website to start. Spend time creating a profile that will attract your target market.  “Create a solid profile (or review your current profile) and include a picture, include information about what differentiates you from other Realtors®, add testimonials and/or recommendations, be clear about how you add value to your buyers/sellers,” says Sheryl Johnson. Set up a “content calendar” to help you stay focused. Once you have set an online presence, stay true to your own branding. Your branding is how you want to represent your real estate business. People are looking for a brand they can trust. That trust is created through consistency.</p>
<h2>Short-Term Goals</h2>
<p>Goals help you create actionable social media strategies because they keep you focused and help you measure your progress. “No campaign is the same, but a goal that&#8217;s good for early on is raising brand awareness &#8211; which can be measured through follower count. If you are providing value and interacting with others on social media, more people are going to learn about your business,” says John-Henry Scherck. A high follower count adds value to your brand and attracts customers. However, a high follower count doesn’t measure true engagement. Long-term goals help you keep your followers engaged. People don’t buy property every day, so you want them to remember you when it comes time for them to buy or sell a property.</p>
<h2>Long-Term Goals</h2>
<p>Maintain a relationship with your followers. “Engage with your followers. Social media is not about collecting contacts. It is also about interacting with them. This is what will set you apart from others and help you grow your connections,” says Sheryl Johnson. You keep your followers engaged by sharing information that your target market will find relevant to their lives. If your target market is the residential homebuyer, posting informative articles or blogs about commercial real estate will not keep their attention. Your follower numbers will be high, but they won’t translate into more sales. Interacting with your followers by asking questions or answering questions will help you get an accurate assessment of how many people are really following you. When it comes to creating actionable social media strategies, you must see the forest for the trees. This means don’t lose sight of your long-term goals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you type the term “real estate coach” in any search engine, you’re likely to see a long list of websites claiming they have the best coaches for you. It’s easy to see why some real estate agents are weary of finding a coach (hint: If they refer to themselves as a guru, you may want to run).  Despite all the charlatans, it’s worth investigating whether a coach can help you meet your goals before you chalk them up to being snake oil salesmen.</p>
<h2>What Real Estate Coaches Offer</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8191" title="real estate coach" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Fotolia_40675936_XS-198x300.jpg" alt="real estate coach" width="198" height="300" />Just like a baseball, football or basketball coach, a real estate coach helps you come up with a game plan. According to Dave Harding, Chief Research Officer for iHave5Questions, real estate coaches offer four main advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li>Helping you set short-term goals to achieve long-term goals you set for yourself.</li>
<li>Adding to your skills.</li>
<li>Keeping you motivated (to use all your skills, including the ones added by the coach).</li>
<li>Holding you accountable and on track, using 2 and 3 to accomplish 1.</li>
</ol>
<p>A good real estate coach excels at keeping you focused on your goals, coming up with workable strategies and having a way of measuring success. According to Bobby Casey, the Managing Director of Global Wealth Protection, “A coach is typically someone who has been through the process you are currently facing and has come through the battlefield victorious. They can help guide you and avoid some pitfalls you may otherwise miss. If nothing else this person can shoot down your stupid ideas when you think they are world changing.” They may not make you go to the gym, but they’ll help you build a strong company.</p>
<h2>Who Needs Coaching?</h2>
<p>If you are an active real estate agent, you need a coach. Surprised? Even veteran real estate agents employ coaches. The best time to get a coach is at the very start of your career. According to Dave Harding, “As a new practitioner, soak in all the coaching available from your brokerage for the first year, or first calendar year, whichever horizon you will use to benchmark yourself. </p>
<p>Thereafter, you should be supplementing what you get from your broker with you-specific coaching. Accept anything provided by your broker (or franchise parent company, or professional association) but do not rely on that generic support to determine your personal success. Then measure the coach’s contribution. If it’s not working, do what your clients do: Find another professional, but don’t give up on the idea. “</p>
<p>A real estate coach does more than just brainstorm with you about ways to improve your business. In fact, most people don’t suffer from lack of ideas. Most people suffer from disorganization, demotivation and the inability to measure results. For instance, how do you know that your <a href="/blog/real-estate-newsletter-marketing-tips/">newsletter marketing strategy</a> is working? Can you measure how many people saw your Sunday advertisement in the paper? A real estate coach can help you keep track of what is working and how it can be improved.</p>
<h2>Finding a Coach</h2>
<p>You most likely already know your coach. “Sometimes you can get a job working for someone whom you respect and admire. In many cases this leads to a mentor relationship where you can develop that relationship throughout your career. You may also seek out professionals that are successful in your chosen field and offer them something of value in exchange for time granted for educating and working with you in real estate investments. In my experience, this is almost never a financial transaction, but one of exchanging value for value. Maybe you are good at building websites or marketing, so you may offer those services to your targeted coach or mentor in exchange,” says Bobby Case.</p>
<p>No one is an expert in every field. You may need more than one coach. It’s common in business for someone to have various experts they turn to for advice. Perhaps you need a coach for marketing and another one to help you with preparing contracts. A good place to start looking is in your network. Ask other real estate agents if they can recommend a coach. The desire for a real estate coach shows that you are willing to take your business to the next level. A coach can help you every step of the way and cheer for you on the sidelines.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The easiest way to lose focus is to start off with a vague idea of what social media can do for your real estate business. Sure, every other agent and broker has a Facebook page, Twitter account or blog, but you shouldn’t promote your brand through social media just because it’s what the Jones are doing down the street.</p>
<h2>What Social Media Can Accomplish</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8001" title="socia media marketing" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Fotolia_37877338_XS-300x300.jpg" alt="socia media marketing" width="300" height="300" />It’s important to understand the many benefits associated with social media campaigns. According to Neal Cabage, the managing director of Enlogica.com, “Social media is mostly a &#8220;high funnel&#8221; channel, meaning that you are using it to make introductions to your brand and nurture those leads, so that you are top of mind when they are ready to buy or sell real estate in the future. Social media rarely results in near term closing or sales conversion but it is frequently a &#8220;first touch&#8221; or assisting touch point in a longer term marketing campaign.” Everything you do in your social media campaign must support your brand. If you are an expert in commercial real estate, it does little good posting blogs about residential properties. Define who you are through your social media campaign.</p>
<h2>How to Define Yourself</h2>
<p>You don’t need to spend a lot of money hiring a graphic designer to create an ultra hip website or flashy business cards. According to Dominic Morrocco, co-founder of M Squared Real Estate, “Many agents think of their brand as a shiny logo or unique color scheme. When actually, it’s the specific knowledge they possess. From originating new content regarding current changes in the market, new legislative initiatives and local happenings, agents brand themselves as knowledgeable professionals, active in the communities they serve.” Just like your top listings, you should sell yourself with the same amount of enthusiasm.</p>
<p>To create your own unique brand, think about these five things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why are your services valuable to clients?</li>
<li>What do you have to offer that is different than other real estate agents or brokers?</li>
<li>Come up with a brand that is difficult for others to imitate.</li>
<li>Create a punchy tagline that will help people remember you. For example, Nike’s “just do it” campaign won them worldwide recognition.</li>
<li>What are you passionate about?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Being Passionate = Staying Focused</h2>
<p>Being passionate about any topic will help prevent social media burnout or general lack of focus. “To do content and social marketing effectively, you need to become the thought leader on a given topic and that&#8217;s going to mean following the latest news and researching the topic more deeply so you can speak to it authoritatively. Approach this as an overall effort to brand yourself, don&#8217;t just do it for social marketing. This is not only going to be what separates your brand from others, it will be perceived as more authentic if it is your consistent brand,” says Neal Cabage. If you love reporting about different restaurant openings, cultural events or community festivals in your area, write blog postings about these topics. Those who care about interior design can connect to their target market by writing about home renovation or how to add value to property. Becoming a leading authority on something specific will contribute value to your brand.</p>
<h2>Creating a Social Media Schedule</h2>
<p>If you wait around until you feel inspired to write a blog or a post on Facebook, you won’t establish a consistent schedule. Inconsistency is not the hallmark of a successful business or social marketing campaign. “Spend an hour a day either originating new content, or curating existing content that you deem relevant. Whip out a calendar and mark some days of the week off. Here’s a good schedule for you: 1) Monday: best deals under $500,000. 2) Tuesday: Backyard entertaining: best deals with great outdoor space. 3) Wednesday: mid-week roundup: properties on the move, etc.,” says Dominic Morrocco. If you are using Twitter as part of your social marketing campaign, post more often than you would for a blog or Facebook. People don’t read all of their Twitter posts. You don’t have to always come up with a new subject or topic for your “tweets.” In fact, questions such as “Are you ready for this weekend’s big storm?” can establish a connection to your target market and illicit responses that will keep people engaged. Your next post can share a list of open houses that people can check out to get out of the rain.</p>
<h2>Things to Remember</h2>
<p>If you aren’t interested in your social media campaign, it probably isn’t interesting to anyone else. Come up with creative ideas to promote your brand. Treating social media as a fun challenge will help you stay focused and breathe life into your marketing strategies.</p>
