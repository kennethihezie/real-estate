										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Real estate door knocking is by no means an outdated strategy. It remains both a relevant and effective means of generating leads even today.</p>
<p>Take <a href="https://palmdalehomesforsale.wordpress.com/2013/09/13/real-estate-door-knocking-tips-from-a-mega-team/">Tom Mitchell’s story</a>, for example. During the tanking real estate market of 1990, he had two choices: quit (as many fellow agents did) or take the proactive approach. He chose the latter. He started door knocking. He knocked on 250 doors a day. It’s what kept him alive until the market heated up again. Fast forward to 2007 when the market crashed. Mitchell took up door knocking again. And again, it worked. In fact, it earned all $38.8 million of Mitchell’s 2013 closed volume.</p>
<p>But simply “pounding the pavement” isn’t enough. Real estate door knocking is an art and a science—to get new business, you need to know what you&#8217;re doing. Here are the essential tips and ideas you need to get started.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">4 Objections to Door Knocking (And How You Can Overcome Them)</h2>
<p>It doesn’t take much to imagine why some real estate agents shy away from the door knocking strategy. But taking the time to anticipate the obstacles you’ll inevitably face and to learn how to manage them is a worthwhile endeavor. And it can make all the difference in terms of the volume of new clients door knocking yields for you.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Reason #1: The Fear of Rejection</h3>
<p>Let’s be honest, the concern is valid. Door knocking often ends with a door in the face rather than a foot in the door. Getting ignored hurts, and hearing “no” over and over again can be even more painful. No one likes being rejected. Especially when it’s done rudely.</p>
<p>But Business Insider’s Max Nisen recommends that you simply shake it off and move on. How? Remind yourself, Nisen says, that rejection is “specific and temporary.” In other words, the “no” is directed only toward their perception of your offer. It’s not a personal attack. And remember, the shake-it-off-and-move-on tactic is a skill that can be learned and developed with practice.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Reason #2: It’s Time Consuming</h3>
<p>To acknowledge the obvious, door knocking is the most physically demanding lead generation strategy, which also means it’s the most time consuming. Not only does the act of door knocking take a while, but the waiting period between first contact and ultimate reward can also be extensive.</p>
<p>But there are two points to consider here. First, as we’ll see below, the time is well spent. If it’s done right, the return on investment can be extremely lucrative. And second, it will only be as time consuming as you make it. It doesn’t have to consume your work week. Focus on consistency and quality rather than an arbitrary quantity goal.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Reason #3: It’s Not Fun</h3>
<p>When we combine the first two reasons, we arrive at Reason #3: door knocking simply isn’t fun. It lacks the instant gratification we all want. That’s why so many agents are quick to quit this approach. There are too many other things we’d rather be doing, right?</p>
<p>Granted. But when you start seeing the payoffs, you may just learn to love it. This begs the question…</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Does Door Knocking Really Work in Real Estate?</h2>
<p>Yes, it is a tried-and-true lead generation method that still yields significant results. And it seems to be good enough for agents like <a href="https://www.benbacal.com/">Ben Bacal</a>, the Beverly Hills luxury real estate agent who has sold over $1 billion of property throughout his career so far. He and many other top performers are outspoken about the value of door knocking.</p>
<p>In a sense, it’s no different than anything else a real estate agent does. Knocking on doors – metaphorically or otherwise – is what you do, from cold calling to <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/products/real-estate-leads/">buying online real estate leads</a> and from open houses to closings.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Why Is (Literal) Door Knocking Effective?</h2>
<p><strong>1. It allows you to bypass your competition and skip to the top.</strong> While many are waiting for clients to come to them, digitally or otherwise, you can be the one to put yourself in the way of your ideal clients by literally showing up at their doorstep. It’s a great way to tip the odds in your favor.</p>
<p><strong>2. The cost is low.</strong> Sure, there’s an opportunity cost to weigh, and your time is expensive. But unless you’re driving long distances, the hard costs associated with the door knocking itself are minimal. It’s not quite free, of course, but almost. Especially when compared to the dividends that stream in after just one hot lead.</p>
<p><strong>3. It’s as personal and relational as real estate prospecting can get.</strong> The face-to-face interactions you have are invaluable because of the major advantage it gives you over other agents.</p>
<p>Okay, all of that sounds reasonable in theory. But let’s be more concrete about this: how effective is door knocking exactly?</p>
<p>Of course, it’s impossible to pin down an exact conversion rate that every agent everywhere can bank on. Like many other lead generation strategies, there are many variables each agent needs to consider for themselves.</p>
<p>But one thing is certain: it’s a reliable lead generation method.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://hackingrealestatemarketing.com/does-door-knocking-work-in-real-estate/">one recent study</a> showed that, in general, you can expect a “conversion rate or response rate of 20% and a sales conversion rate of 2%.” Going even further, it suggests that you can expect a cost per acquisition of $15.65 and a cost per contract/sale of $156.55.</p>
<p>Upon first glance, a 2% sales conversion rate might not raise any eyebrows. But think of it this way: An agent can generate two sales after just two hours of work (if he or she knocked on 100 doors). That’s a sizable return to which not even cold calling can compare.</p>
<p>Are those figures going to be the same for everyone? Absolutely not. This isn’t an exact science. There’s no need to count every last penny as part of your own cost-benefit analysis. But even if we use these figures as ballpark estimates, door knocking seems to have an appealing potential.</p>
<p>The key is, you have to know how to do it the right way. Here are the essential tips you need to get started.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">The Best Tips for Effective Real Estate Door Knocking</h2>
<p><strong>Look the part.</strong> Dress professionally, but for your market. If you sell real estate in casual Manhattan Beach, California, you don’t want to wear a shirt and tie. But in Manhattan, New York, you might want to consider it. The point is, pick your outfit according to the neighborhood’s culture and style and what “I’m the agent you’ve been looking for” looks like for your particular area. Presentation is everything.</p>
<p><strong>Think small.</strong> Set the ultimate goal aside for now and focus on being genuinely helpful. The immediate priority is far narrower. After all, contracts are never signed over the welcome mat anyway, right? No one wants to keep their door open to a shark who’s obviously just trying to make a sale, so keep relationship at the center.</p>
<p><strong>Set goals and track your progress.</strong> For example, keep record of the number of homes you intend to visit for a certain time period, store your <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/why-relationship-management-crm-is-crucial-in-real-estate-5-ways-to-maximize-roi/">leads’ contact information</a>, how many leads you’ve acquired, the number of listings, and the income you’ve generated. Give yourself a roadmap to success.</p>
<p><strong>Bring something to leave behind.</strong> If it’s a marketing piece, make sure it’s branded with your information. If you really want to go the extra mile to create a lasting impression, bring a small gift to share – maybe a pastry from the bakery down the street or a simple-but-lovely potted plant.</p>
<p><strong>Use a script.</strong> If you were one of the thousands of agents that took the old Mike Ferry productivity courses years ago, you might remember <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/cold-calling-best-practices/">his cold-calling script</a>. Done right, the script was a business-changer for cold-callers. Get familiar enough with your script that you don’t sound canned but conversational. That way you can concentrate on listening and not on what you want to say.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">3 Conversation-Starter Door-Knocking Scripts</h2>
<p>Here are three scripts you can use that will fit some of the most common situations you’ll encounter when door knocking.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">The Use-Anytime Script</h3>
<div style="background-color: #f6f6f6; padding: 20px 40px 20px 40px;">Hi, my name is <em>[your name]</em> and I’m a real estate agent with <em>[brokerage]</em>. I love your <em>[property feature]</em>! Are you planning on moving anytime soon? I was just curious because I’d be happy to connect you with a buyer.</div>
<h3 class="BlogH3">If You Recently Sold in the Area</h3>
<div style="background-color: #f6f6f6; padding: 20px 40px 20px 40px;">Hi, I’m <em>[your name]</em>. I recently helped your neighbors at <em>[street number]</em> sell their house for around <em>[price]</em>! Would you be interested in receiving a free valuation of your home?</div>
<h3 class="BlogH3">The Update Script</h3>
<div style="background-color: #f6f6f6; padding: 20px 40px 20px 40px;">Hi! Sorry to bother you. I’m a real estate agent from <em>[brokerage]</em> and I just wanted to stop by real quick with an update. I thought maybe you’d be interested to know that similar houses in your neighborhood have been selling for around <em>[price]</em>. Do you have any interest in moving?</div>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Overnight Success Is a Myth</h2>
<p>Door knocking can be a great way to generate leads. But let’s be honest. It takes time. In a way, it’s similar to farming. It requires a high level of persistence, consistency, and wherewithal to “plant the seeds,” so to speak.</p>
<p>But farmers don’t merely stand back and hope the seeds grow. They have to water and nurture the field. For you, that might include a thank you note a week later, a value-packed direct mail piece, a monthly email, or a quarterly call. The fortune is in the follow-up.</p>
<p>After all, you’re going to be knocking on doors, not walls. And whether it feels like it or not, every open door presents a new opportunity. The sooner you get started, the sooner you’ll reap results.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/door-knocking-real-estate/">Don’t Knock It Until You Try It: Door Knocking Tips for Real Estate Agents</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If there is one thing real estate agents dislike, it’s parting with money. Low or no cost approaches are thus highly treasured, such as the use of social media as a marketing tool and the heavy reliance on do-it-yourself photography.</p>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with being frugal. Even wealthy people know this—many are actually quite thrifty, pinching pennies and living beneath their means. So, in the spirit of helping you hang on to every possible commission dollar, here’s the skinny on hiring an intern.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">What Exactly Is an Intern?</h2>
<p>An intern is a person who works primarily to gain experience in a field. Some work for free. It may sound crazy, but they have their reasons for offering their services without receiving compensation in return.</p>
<p>Most interns are young and usually in college. In fact, around 40 percent of college students work as unpaid interns, according to the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/17/more-than-40percent-of-interns-are-still-unpaidwhy-thats-legal.html">National Association of Colleges and Employers</a>.</p>
<p>If you hope to hire an intern to assist you with various duties for your real estate practice, however, you will most likely need to pay them. (More on that in a minute.)</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">The Duties of a Real Estate Intern</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://realestate.business.uconn.edu/career-opportunities/intern-program/">University of Connecticut School of Business</a> offers a well-structured intern program. While they acknowledge that intern responsibilities will vary from firm to firm, some general duties they suggest include:</p>
<ul class="BlogUL">
<li class="BlogLI">Participating in the preparation of market analyses</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Researching records and real estate statistics</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Attending appraisals, to gain experience in assigning value to real property</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Using the MLS to find properties that match a buyer’s criteria</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Preparing and maintaining lists of FSBO properties and expired listings</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Updating and maintaining your <a href="/solutions/crm/">real estate CRM</a></li>
<li class="BlogLI">Assisting in transaction coordination</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Assisting with the open house process</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Website development and/or maintenance</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Writing copy for ads, your website, and <a href="/solutions/marketing-automation/">email marketing campaigns</a></li>
<li class="BlogLI">Maintaining the agent’s presence on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media accounts</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, the tasks you assign the intern will be based in large part on the intern’s talents, knowledge, experience and what he or she hopes to learn while working with you.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Your Commitment to Your Interns</h2>
<p>Hiring an intern may not be the ideal situation for a time-pinched agent with no staff. Providing a valuable hands-on experience for the intern will require direct training from you or a staff member. Remember, an unpaid intern is trading labor for real-life training and experience.</p>
<p>This might be hard to hear, but if you’re a busy solo agent, you should probably hire an experienced assistant instead, either an in-house or <a href="/blog/is-there-roi-in-virtual-assistants-for-real-estate-agents/">virtual assistant</a>.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Do Real Estate Interns Get Paid?</h2>
<p>Unpaid labor is the dream of many small business owners. Who wouldn’t want someone that comes to work, contributes to the business, and expects nothing in return except the ability to gain knowledge and experience?</p>
<p>It doesn’t quite work that way, however. There are legal requirements for unpaid internships that you must follow if you want to hire someone who will work for free. And, similarly, there are federal laws you must follow if you hire a paid intern.</p>
<p>Federal guidelines clearly define what you must do if you hope to hire unpaid interns. In fact, there are <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/71-flsa-internships">six criteria</a>, and you must abide by all of them, otherwise the intern will be considered an employee.</p>
<p>To hire an unpaid intern, all of the following must apply:</p>
<ol class="BlogOL">
<li class="BlogLI">You must provide an educational environment. This means that the training you supply must be similar to what the intern would receive at a vocational school or academic institution.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">What the intern experiences must directly benefit him or her. The law requires that “the intern does not perform the routine work of the business on a regular and recurring basis, and the business is not dependent upon the work of the intern.”</li>
<li class="BlogLI">The intern is not hired as a replacement for a regular employee, “but works under close supervision of existing staff.”</li>
<li class="BlogLI">You do not derive an advantage from the intern’s work. The guidelines even go on to say that, on occasion, the business’s operations “may actually be impeded” by the intern’s activities. The law states that if the intern is performing routine productive work, such as filing or other clerical work or assisting customers, “then the fact that they may be receiving some benefits in the form of a new skill or improved work habits will not exclude them from the Fair Labor Standards Act’s (FLSA) minimum wage and overtime requirements, because the employer benefits from the interns’ work.”</li>
<li class="BlogLI">The internship is for a fixed period, and there is no expectation that the intern will be given a job after the internship is completed. Otherwise, it appears that you are hiring unpaid interns for a trial period, after which you will hire them permanently—a condition the FLSA considers employment.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">There is an understanding between you and the intern that he or she is not entitled to wages for the work performed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Number four will be the clincher for most real estate agents. After all, the whole idea of hiring an intern for a real estate practice is to get some help with routine business tasks.</p>
<p>That brings us to a more likely scenario: hiring a paid intern. This creates an employment relationship, with the attendant <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2013/04/19/6-legal-requirements-for-unpaid-internship-programs/?sh=71c0ca8f6bf1">responsibilities</a> for worker’s compensation, employee benefits, discrimination laws, state labor laws and unemployment insurance coverage. Agents who require assistance with the day-to-day tasks of running their business rarely have time to deal with the intricacies of hiring and paying employees.</p>
<p>Assuming that you still want to hire an intern: Think it’s okay to pay minimum wage? Think again, oh frugal real estate agent. The average hourly wage for interns at the bachelor’s degree level is $15.07 in 2022, <a href="https://www.ziprecruiter.com/Salaries/Intern-Salary-per-Hour">according to ZipRecruiter</a>.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Where to Find Real Estate Internships</h2>
<p>You can find interns looking for work at local colleges and universities. An ad on Craigslist will most likely pique some interest as well, especially if it’s a paid internship.</p>
<p>Finally, online sites such as <a href="https://www.internships.com/employer/resources/recruit">Internships.com</a> accept recruitment posts.</p>
<p>Internships may seem like an easy way to get free or cheap labor. However, the federal government—and the interns themselves—feel otherwise. If you truly require help, but lack the funds to hire an assistant, consider a piecemeal approach. Outsource your marketing, writing or database tasks. Even one duty taken off your plate frees up time for you to spend on more important aspects of your business.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/real-estate-interns/">Real Estate Internships—What to Know Before You Hire</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/real-estate-volunteer-opportunities/">Real Estate Agent Volunteer Opportunities & Benefits</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10171" title="" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Fotolia_45509575_XS-300x211.jpg" alt="Real estate agent volunteer opportunities abound for agents willing to devote their time to good causes" width="300" height="211" />There are two types of community involvement that real estate agents typically gravitate toward. First, there are the agencies and individual agents that give money to a cause and consider it “community involvement.” Their websites typically boast that they’ll give “$100 from every home sale to the Breast Cancer Foundation!” or “Fifteen percent of my commission to the local humane society!”</p>
<p>That sort of giving is admirable, and a boon to the charity recipient, but although the agents like to call it “community involvement,” it isn’t. Cutting a check to a charity, again while laudable, takes five minutes of one’s time and is more appropriately called “community giving.”</p>
<p>The type of community involvement that other agents gravitate toward is hands-on volunteerism: the boots-on-the-ground, belly-to-belly, nitty-gritty of community involvement.</p>
<p>While neither of these types of giving back to the community is necessarily “better” in the main, the latter is hands down better for your real estate business. Quite frankly, the type of giving back that puts you face-to-face with groups of people who may turn into clients is good for business.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">The Benefits of Volunteering for Realtors</h2>
<p>Gasp! Community giving in the real estate world isn’t completely altruistic?</p>
<p>Well, not completely.</p>
<p>Sure, it may start out as a selfless desire to give to others, but side benefits of community involvement include the fact that it’s an awesome way to generate leads, get your name linked to the community, and increase your brand and public persona.</p>
<p>But that side of the coin is a dirty little secret that agents don’t typically talk about.</p>
<p>Agent Linda Lougee, of Realty of Maine, isn’t ashamed to speak about what volunteerism has done for her business. She works with the local Chamber of Commerce and with the General Federation of Women’s Clubs. She joined both out of a desire to give back to those who helped build her business and to the community at large. What she found was the perfect networking vehicle.</p>
<p>“I think you have to network,” Lougee says, even when volunteering for a higher cause.</p>
<p>Lougee isn’t referring to that habit of constantly selling themselves that many agents have. This type of networking involves subtle reminders that you’re a real estate agent, and helps keep your name top-of-mind with other volunteers or civic club members.</p>
<p>Mike McCann, a broker from Nebraska, doesn’t pull any punches when describing how his volunteerism has benefitted his real estate business. Although being a volunteer soccer coach is the activity that brought him the most leads, helping out at church has its benefits as well.</p>
<p>“One time I volunteered to help set up the tents at the church picnic, and the priest was impressed with how I was with my son and bought a house using me. [It] made the other 14 or so agents in the parish a little jealous. They should have volunteered,” he relates in an ActiveRain blog post entitled “<a href="https://activerain.com/blogsview/2653369/volunteering---get-involved-and-make-money---dbc--17">Volunteering &#8230; Get Involved and Make Money</a>.”</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Top Real Estate Agent Volunteer Opportunities</h2>
<p>If you’re ready to get involved in your community, whether out of the goodness of your heart or to network for leads, finding volunteer opportunities with large organizations is easy.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Nonprofits</h3>
<p>If you currently don’t volunteer your time to any organization or are looking for additional opportunities, there are several websites with volunteer opportunity databases, sorted by zip code.</p>
<ul>
<li>A great first stop is at <a href="https://www.volunteermatch.org/">VolunteerMatch</a>. Here you can search by zip code and enter keywords to narrow the search for results more specific to your interests.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Agents who are 55 years of age or older, especially those specializing in the boomer niche, might want to try out Get Involved!, a program sponsored by Senior Corps.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.allforgood.org/">All for Good</a>, a service of Points of Light, has a huge database of community service opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Civic Clubs</h3>
<ul>
<li>All 1.35 million worldwide members of the granddaddy of all civic organizations, Lions Club, share one belief: “Community is what we make it.”  You can find a club in your area at the <a href="https://www.lionsclubs.org/en/start-our-approach/club-locator">Lions Club International</a> website.</li>

<ul>
<li>Rotary International not only offers help locally and worldwide, but membership offers tremendous networking opportunities, according to Pete Sinsky, a Rotarian from Wisconsin. “Rotary provides an environment for developing strong friendships and business relationships.” Visit the <a href="https://www.rotary.org/en/get-involved/join">Rotary International</a> website to find out how to get involved.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.kiwanis.org/clubs/find-a-club">Kiwanis International</a> offers volunteer opportunities to help children and families in your community.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Smaller groups that cater to different ethnicities may be ideal for the agent who specializes in a certain ethnic market. The <a href="https://www.ushcc.com/">Hispanic Chamber of Commerce</a>, for instance, can steer you toward local groups that offer help to the Hispanic community. If you market your business to Pacific Islanders, contact the <a href="https://aohcc.org/">Association of Hawaiian Civic Clubs</a> to find out how you can get involved. Larger cities and communities have nonprofits that cater to a wide variety of ethnicities.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The average age of members of some of the larger groups, such as Kiwanis, is 50, which may be uncomfortable for younger agents. The <a href="https://www.jciusa.org/">U.S. Junior Chamber of Commerce</a>, on the other hand, serves people between the ages of 18 and 41 and tends to draw more toward the younger end of the spectrum – late 20s and early 30s. The junior chamber not only provides opportunities to perform community service, but offers leadership training and opportunities to improve business skills.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Hyper-Local Volunteer Opportunities</h2>
<p>Tucson, Ariz. agent Kim Murray tells a story about her volunteer work for an annual golf event in her target community, Dove Mountain.<strong> “</strong>There were over 400 people at that party, and while I didn&#8217;t meet all of them, I certainly did meet a lot,” she relates in an ActiveRain blog post. “In one day’s work, I mixed and mingled with my target community and demographic. This would have been difficult to do if I were going door to door as the Dove Mountain community is segmented between an active adult community and single family residences,” Murray continues.</p>
<p>“In addition to all the above listed networking, I came away with a deeper attachment to the community as a result of the wonderful people I met on that day.”</p>
<p>Just as some agents are focusing their real estate businesses to a precise niche, some are doing the same with their community involvement. The opportunities to volunteer at a hyper-local level are endless:</p>
<ul>
<li>Volunteer to coach a community athletic team. Soccer, baseball, football, tennis – whichever sport you’re good at, the leagues will most likely welcome your talents.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>All schools can use some volunteer help, so find out the needs of those in your farm area.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Churches are great places to volunteer, especially one in your target area.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Community theater groups often need volunteers, and it’s a great way to meet locals.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether an agent’s motives are humanitarian or professional, getting involved in the local community at a volunteer level offers a variety of benefits, including the opportunity to network for new clients.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/real-estate-volunteer-opportunities/">Real Estate Agent Volunteer Opportunities & Benefits</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When was the last time you took some time off? Since most real estate agents rarely take vacation time, you probably can’t remember.</p>
<p>If you’re feeling chained to your client list and think it’s impossible for you to take a vacation, think again. The world—and your business—won’t fall apart if you take some time for yourself. Your mind and body will, however, if you don’t.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Why Real Estate Agents Need Vacation Time</h2>
<p>If you earn in excess of $100,000, you <a href="/blog/a-portrait-of-the-agent-realtor-habit-survey/">probably</a> work more hours than your colleagues who make less money. In fact, around 40 percent of agents in that income bracket work more than 50 hours a week, according to an Inman study. And the hours increase with income: More than 50 percent of agents that earn $200,000 or more work more than 50 hours a week.</p>
<p>That amount of time spent working means stress, fewer hours spent with family and no time to yourself—potentially a recipe for disaster. “The impact that taking a vacation has on one&#8217;s mental health is profound,” clinical psychologist Francine Lederer <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/vacations-2011-time-off-improves-productivity-reducing-stress/story?id=14293331">tells ABC News</a>. &#8220;Most people have better life perspective and are more motivated to achieve their goals after a vacation, even if it is a 24-hour time-out.&#8221;</p>
<p>If that doesn’t convince you that you need time off periodically, consider the famous <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/07/business/yourmoney/07shortcuts.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;">Framingham Heart Study</a>. The results found that women who seldom vacationed—every six years or less—were eight times more likely to have a heart attack or to develop heart disease than those who took at least two vacations each year.</p>
<p>“It shows how the body reacts to a lifestyle of stress. This is real evidence that vacations are important to your physical health,” Elaine Eaker, a co-author of the study, told the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/07/business/yourmoney/07shortcuts.html?pagewanted=all">New York Times</a>. Another study cited by the Times showed that men who didn’t take a vacation every year were 32 percent more likely to die from a heart attack than those who did take an annual getaway.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s scary to think of leaving your clients and your business behind. But leave you must, for both your mental and physical health. Here are some ideas for how you can do it.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Take on a Partner</h2>
<p>If you are so busy that you wouldn’t dream of taking vacation time for fear that your real estate business would fall apart, maybe it’s time to take on a partner. Yes, you’ll be splitting your commissions, but with two sets of commissions coming in, you may not even feel a pinch.</p>
<p>A partner can take over the business while you take some time off. “You can take vacations—real vacations—ones where you do NO work,” author, speaker and real estate trainer Kelle Sparta <a href="http://activerain.com/blogsview/950580/working-with-a-partner---the-team-approach-to-real-estate">says on ActiveRain</a>. “It means, in short, a higher quality of life.”</p>
<p>Trainer and author Jennifer Allan-Hagedorn says that “One of the toughest things about being self-employed is finding someone reliable to watch your business so that you can get away… vacation coverage is a prime benefit to having a partner.”</p>
<p>“It’s blissful actually, especially if you’ve been selling real estate a long time. Your first vacation when you truly don’t have to worry about business? You’ll wonder why you didn’t get a partner before,” Hagedorn concludes.</p>
<p>Alas, partnerships aren’t for everyone. If that includes you, read on.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Hire Someone</h2>
<p>When you expand your solo practice to a team, you aren’t really “hiring” other agents any more than your broker hired you. They remain independent contractors. Most solo agents hire a buyer’s agent first. That agent is perfectly capable of handling your clients while you’re out of town to enjoy some time off.</p>
<p>If you insist on remaining solo, at least think about taking on an assistant. A licensed assistant can perform most of the duties that will be required in your absence. A <a href="/blog/real-estate-virtual-assistant/">virtual assistant</a> or <a href="/blog/real-estate-interns/">intern</a> can help lighten your workload with administrative tasks.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Borrow Someone</h2>
<p>If you don’t want to partner up and you can’t stand the thought of hiring anyone, but you need some time off, hand over your current business to a fellow agent in your office. You’ll have to be willing to split your commission, of course, but if you agree with the psychologists and studies mentioned about the importance of taking time off, it will be worth it.</p>
<p>If push comes to shove, take just one day off to start. Explore your local area, hike, bike, go to a movie or get reacquainted with your family. Make sure you unplug the phone and keep the laptop closed. This is no-work time, no matter what.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/real-estate-agent-vacation-time/">Get Out of Town!

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You know all that stuff you want potential clients to know about you? How easy you are to work with, how experienced and knowledgeable you are and how you saved a particular transaction?</p>
<p>You can, as many agents do, create a space on your website to list all of that. But most of these pieces come off as far too salesy and way too much like what every other agent in town says about themselves.</p>
<p>And, it’s not just real estate agent marketing that creates skepticism in consumers – today, any claims by any company that aren’t backed up by consumer reviews are treated with suspicion.</p>
<h2><strong>If you aren’t collecting agent reviews – aka testimonials &#8212; from your clients, you should start</strong></h2>
<p>More than 85 percent of consumers check a local business’ reviews online, according to the Local Consumer Review Survey 2018 from <a href="https://www.brightlocal.com/research/local-consumer-review-survey/">BrightLocal.com</a> a firm that offers reputation management services, among others.</p>
<p>And, 27 percent of these consumers looked for a business review online daily, the study claims.</p>
<p>Sadly, more than half of those in the ideal real estate demographic (ages 35 to 54) are more likely to read reviews for restaurants and cafés than real estate agents.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean they don’t check real estate agent reviews, because they do.</p>
<h2><strong>It’s “social proof” and all agents need it</strong></h2>
<p>“ … we determine what is correct by finding out what other people think is correct,” according to psychologist <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/006124189X/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0">Robert Cialdini</a>, who coined the phrase “social proof” in his 2009 book, <em>Influence: Science and Practice.</em></p>
<p>It’s a bit hard to admit that we’re basically sheep, looking to others to find out what is correct, what is “best.” But that’s exactly what we do, especially when we’re feeling uncertain.</p>
<p>“Uncertainty is the fuel that activates and feeds the mechanisms of social proof. When faced with an unfamiliar situation, an unsure individual would feel the need to refer to other people for guidance,” claims an unnamed writer at <a href="https://www.psychologynoteshq.com/social-proof/">PsychologyNotesHQ.com</a>.</p>
<p>In real estate, social proof offers proof of your credibility, removes that uncertainty (thereby instilling trust) and helps consumers get to know you.</p>
<h2><strong>How to choose which testimonials to use in your marketing</strong></h2>
<p>Believe it or not, not all reviews that seem “good” are actually good for your marketing efforts. Thankfully, surveys and studies show us which ones to trash and which to use.</p>
<h3>Regardless of how amazing a review is, don’t use it if any of the following apply:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The review is older than three months. Consumers find these reviews irrelevant.</li>
<li>Reviews that are unsigned or use initials. Zillow or Yelp usernames instead of real names destroys the value of a review. Consumers think they are “fake.” Ask your clients to use their first and last name when they leave a review.</li>
</ul>
<h3>According to the Bright Local survey, consumers place the most value on the number of stars in a rating and then, in order of importance to them:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Quantity of reviews</li>
<li>Recency</li>
<li>Length/detail</li>
<li>Sentiment of the review</li>
<li>Business response or non/response</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>How to use your real estate agent reviews</strong></h2>
<p>Naturally you should have a section of your website devoted to your testimonials, but don’t stop there.</p>
<p>Choose one line from one of your favorite reviews. Ensure it encapsulates exactly why a real estate consumer should choose you above all other agents in your market.</p>
<p>It’s tempting to choose the most flattering-to-your-ego testimonial, but don’t do it. A <a href="https://magazine.realtor/sales-and-marketing/feature/article/2015/03/what-your-online-about-me-says-about-you">REALTOR® Magazine survey</a> of real estate consumers finds that they are “strongly critical of agents who posted testimonials that appeared overly self-serving.”</p>
<p>Instead, choose one that highlights your success in overcoming a typical real estate consumer pain point.</p>
<p>A testimonial that mentioned how the agent sold the home “in 19 days for asking price” was particularly attractive to the panelists in the aforementioned survey.</p>
<p>One panelist said that the days on market mention gave the testimonia credibility, “considering many online agent reviews are less detailed and sound automated.”</p>
<p>Consider this when choosing that one line from a testimonial. If you’re having trouble choosing, ask a non-real estate related friend or family member to read your testimonials and pick out one sentence that would make them want to call you.</p>
<p>Then, use that one-line quote above the fold on your website, in your email signature and wherever else you can plaster it.</p>
<p>Real estate reviews allow consumers to get an idea of what you’re like to work with, how well you negotiate, market and overall perform your job.</p>
<p>They can also help boost your credibility and instill trust.</p>
<p>Whether it’s where to eat dinner on Friday night, which movie to watch or which real estate agent to choose, social proof, in the form of reviews, is one of the most powerful marketing tools around.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/how-to-maximize-the-power-of-real-estate-agent-reviews-testimonials/">How to Maximize the Power of Real Estate Agent Reviews & Testimonials</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After decades of coasting along relatively comfortably, the real estate industry is facing an onslaught of disruptors. It started with the listing portals – Zillow, Trulia and the others.</p>
<p>In the beginning, they were primarily lead generators (and lead sellers) and they stayed away from actual transactions.</p>
<p>Then, OpenDoor launched in 2014 and the industry began changing. This company and its imitators began “moving closer to the transaction … getting involved in more parts of” it, Michael DelPrete claims in an Inman Select <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2OmyguHNQE&amp;feature=youtu.be">video</a>.</p>
<p>With Instant Offers, he says, Zillow began “moving from search engine to service engine.”</p>
<p>Today, there are several others in the iBuyer space, all clamoring for the holy grail of real estate: listings.</p>
<h2><strong>What is an iBuyer?</strong></h2>
<p>iBuyers are quite similar to the cash-heavy real estate investors who make rock bottom offers on homes, fix them up and flip them. Apparently, iBuyers bristle at being called “flippers,” but that’s pretty much what they are.</p>
<p>But, that’s an opinion and, like all opinions, there’s an opposing side. Some, like the brilliant Notorious R.O.B, beg to differ.</p>
<p>“iBuyer is Not Real Estate Investing; Real Estate Investing is Not iBuyer,” he <a href="https://notorious-rob.com/2018/11/the-case-for-ibuyer-becoming-the-default/">says</a> and for proof of his point he quotes (wait for it) <em>Spencer Rascoff</em>.</p>
<p>Rascoff’s argument, by the way, is that “Flipping requires distressed homes and distressed sellers, people that are selling their home under duress, and it only applies to a very small segment of the market.”</p>
<p>Those who utilize the services of iBuyer companies, on the other hand, favor “speed, certainty, ease, convenience,” Rascoff continues.</p>
<p>Who is he trying to kid?</p>
<p>“The motivated Seller who wants to sell fast, is willing to sell low, and does not want to work with an agent is the one the Investor wants,” says an investor at BiggerPockets.com. She describes the very <em>same</em> consumer that iBuyers target.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>So, buying homes at less-than-market value, fixing them up and then reselling them is called “flipping,” but <em>not</em> when Zillow does it.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>In fact, all of the companies in this space stress (repeatedly) that their home sale process is “convenient and hassle-free.”</p>
<p>The bottom line for the consumer, however, is that iBuyers use automated value models (AVMs) and we all know how unreliable those are. Then, there are plenty of horror stories from home sellers about the pitiably small offers they’ve received.</p>
<p>“An agent in Atlanta requested offers on his own newly renovated home with OpenDoor, Knock, and OfferPad to see how the process worked,” explains an unnamed writer at MetroBrokers.com.</p>
<blockquote><p>“His property, which was appraised at $495,000, received [iBuyer] offers from $265,000 on the low end to $373,000 on the high end.”</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s easy to read that and assume that iBuyers are going nowhere, fast. And, nationally, they only capture 0.2 percent of the market (2018, all U.S. iBuyers), according to DelPrete.</p>
<p>But he also goes on to remind us that all real estate is local: “In November of 2018, in Phoenix, the market share of all iBuyers was 5 percent.”</p>
<p>Zillow’s Instant Offer generated 20,000 Phoenix listing leads in its first four months in the market. That’s 20,000 homeowners in one city who actually clicked through and requested an offer from Zillow, DelPrete explains.</p>
<p>Impressive, right?</p>
<h2><strong>Is there any good news for agents in all this?</strong></h2>
<p>Let’s get back to those 20,000 leads that Zillow generated. DelPrete says that the company purchased only one percent of the homes.</p>
<p>Unlike agents, however, Zillow doesn’t <a href="/blog/the-biggest-mistakes-agents-make-with-leads/">throw away leads</a> that don’t or can’t immediately transact. In fact, they’ll be selling 99 percent of those 20,000 leads to you guys.</p>
<p>These are leads who were motivated enough to ask Zillow for an evaluation of their home’s value for possible participation in the Instant Offer program. So, motivation is the bonus.</p>
<p>The downside to these leads is that they’ll most likely haggle over your commission and they may be unrealistic about their price (thus why Zillow didn’t work with them).</p>
<h2><strong>How can agents compete?</strong></h2>
<p>This is one of those question that stumps the industry. Many agents feel that they don’t need to compete.</p>
<p>“Because the one thing startups can’t disrupt is the real estate agent,” according to Henry Grabar, staff writer for <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2018/06/redfin-zillow-and-opendoor-cant-disrupt-real-estate-agents-and-may-not-want-to.html">Slate.com’s Moneybox</a></p>
<p>Perhaps making just a few changes, if performed en masse, is the answer.</p>
<p>Presenting your services in a more positive light will go a long way in combatting the lure of convenience and the “hassle-free” process that iBuyers promote.</p>
<p>Sure, selling a home is somewhat of a hassle. Remind potential listing clients that with the right agent, it can be a smooth process and bring in top dollar for the home.</p>
<h2><strong>In short, watch your words.</strong></h2>
<p>I recently read a real estate blog post that began with an entire paragraph about just how much of a hassle selling a home can be.</p>
<p>“Selling your house can be one of the most stressful events of your life,” it begins. Then, there’s the attempt to scare the you-know-what out of the seller by reminding him or her that the home will be open to “total strangers.”</p>
<p>The negativity doesn’t stop there, though. The third sentence reminds the seller that “you’re facing the daunting task of moving in the (hopefully near) future, and you’re worried about the finances of selling your home.”</p>
<p>Not content with reminding the reader that moving is a “daunting task,” the writer also felt the need to slip in a hint that the home <em>may</em> not sell in the near future.</p>
<p>Finishing up this completely stupefying paragraph is the reminder that “uncertainty” underlies the entire home sale process: “will you find a good buyer in time, will you get a fair value for your home, and will the sale of your home go smoothly?”</p>
<p>I don’t know about you, but after reading this, I’d sincerely consider going with an iBuyer.</p>
<p>I get it. If you explain just how complex the home sale process is, sellers will be less likely to go FSBO.</p>
<p>But FSBO isn’t their only option in 2019. While some agents are sounding like Debbie Downer in their marketing copy, the iBuyer folks are all sunshine and unicorns in explaining how easy-breezy their process is.</p>
<h2><strong>Use iBuyers&#8217; ignorance to your benefit.</strong></h2>
<p>You, as a boot on the ground, have the experience of working directly with real estate consumers. Perhaps decades of this experience. You know what they want and what they don’t want.</p>
<p>Those at the top of the iBuyer chain do not. In fact, at least in Zillow’s case, they’ve vastly misunderstood the typical home seller. Jeremy Wacksman, Zillow’s chief marketing officer, claims to know exactly what home sellers want.</p>
<p>“What they care about is pushing the button and making magic happen,” he claims.</p>
<p>“Magic, in this case, means selling your house in a matter of days, even at a small discount,” Grabar adds.</p>
<p>Can anyone be more out of touch with the average real estate consumer? Yes, home sellers would LOVE to have a “magic button.” Their idea of “magic,” however, is selling the house in a matter of days FOR FULL MARKET VALUE.</p>
<p><strong>How many sellers have you dealt with who were willing to take one cent less than what their home is worth just to have it sell quicker? </strong></p>
<p>Let’s agree that from here forward, your marketing to home sellers will be more positive about the process. Remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your method of determining their home’s value is far superior to an AVM.</li>
<li>Even Spencer Rascoff’s home value wasn’t nailed by Zillow’s AVM.</li>
<li>Since iBuyer fees are higher than real estate commissions (at least for now), home sellers working with an agent will not only make more money from the sale but have professional representation as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally? We don’t think you have anything to worry about.</p>
<p>The lazy agent, the complacent agent and the one who is in it just for the money?</p>
<p>They should worry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Holes in Real Estate Training And How to Fill Them </strong></h1>
<p>If you consider your continuing education courses to be “real estate training,” you’re missing an amazing opportunity to increase your knowledge of real estate and, thus, increase your market share.</p>
<p>Yes, CE courses are mandatory, but they are in no way training you to be a better agent. They won’t help you to be a better negotiator, to market homes or to efficiently and successfully work with buyers.</p>
<p>That education is up to you to pursue. Or, you can choose not to bone up on the truly important stuff and be a mediocre player in your chosen profession.</p>
<h2>Master marketing.</h2>
<p>Real estate schools and real estate brokers aren’t known for teaching agents how to market homes. It’s why there are so many “list and pray” listing agents out there and why so many homes languish in buyers’ markets.</p>
<p>Sure, you can follow the crowd, copying what other listing agents are doing. But if what they’re doing isn’t working for them, what makes you think it will work for you?</p>
<p>Then, there’s your business marketing. If you are early in your career, learning how to market yourself and your services is paramount to not only making a living but building a referral base to keep you going down the line.</p>
<p>If you’re past the rookie stuff, how are you differentiating yourself from the rest of the agents in town?</p>
<p>Marketing is one of the biggest holes in real estate training. And, when the day is consumed with generating and following up on real estate leads and servicing existing clients, who has time to fill that hole?</p>
<p>But, fill it you must, and, with just a few hours a week you can learn how to become a better marketer and move away from the pack of the more complacent agents in town.</p>
<p>The Digital Marketing Institute offers marketing courses with certificates upon completion. If I were interviewing listing agents, the Certified Digital Marketing Specialist is going to impress far more than the agents with those NAR designation abbreviations trailing their names.</p>
<p>Download the brochure at <a href="https://digitalmarketinginstitute.com/students/courses/professional-certificate-in-digital-marketing-usa">DigitalMarketingInstitute.com</a>. The courses are pricey but they offer financing and, remember that the cost is most likely tax deductible.</p>
<p>Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management offers Digital Marketing Strategies &#8212; an online, go-at-your-own-pace course. Learn more <a href="https://online.em.kellogg.northwestern.edu/digital-marketing-strategies">here</a>.</p>
<p>Check with your association too, since they often offer marketing courses.</p>
<p>If you just can’t find the time to take classes, learn by reading.</p>

<h2>Hire a coach.</h2>
<p>If stars the caliber of Brad Pitt and Halle Berry use coaches, perhaps real estate agents can benefit from hiring a one too? Just a thought, but if you’re struggling to learn different aspects to running your business, a coach may just be the answer.</p>
<p>We recently covered the whole <a href="/blog/why-every-agent-should-get-real-estate-coaching/">real estate coach thing, in detail.</a> In a nutshell, a coach can help you improve various aspects of your business and how to attract clients.</p>
<p>Some real estate coaches are generalists, such as the brilliant <a href="https://goborino.com/">Borino</a>, while others, like <a href="https://www.floydwickman.com/">Floyd Wickman</a>, specialize in just a few aspects of the real estate business.</p>
<p>Then, there are the different ways you can receive your coaching. <a href="https://craigproctor.com/">Craig Proctor</a>, for instance, offers webinars, one-on-one coaching and more. Many coaches offer phone support.</p>
<p>All Market Leader customers have access to the <a href="/resources/million-dollar-pipeline-program/">Million Dollar Pipeline Program</a>, an exclusive real estate coaching program that provides tools and techniques to exceed transaction goals and scale your business with on-demand webinars, scripts, templates, and a closed Facebook group with access to top-performing agents and peers.</p>
<p>Or consider <a href="https://www.score.org/find-mentor">free business mentoring</a> from a retired executive. You’ll find that and more at your local SCORE office.</p>
<p>SCORE also offers free <a href="https://www.score.org/content/take-workshop">online workshops</a>.</p>
<h2>Learn how to efficiently run a small business.</h2>
<p>Knowing how to run a small business is undoubtedly another hole in your real estate education. From business and marketing plans to budgets, hiring and all the other details you’re responsible for, learning more about small business success is vital.</p>
<p>There are a variety of ways to get started backfilling this hole in your education. The <a href="https://www.sba.gov/sba-learning-platform">U.S. Small Business Administration</a> offers a number of online courses. Here are examples of some of the free, online courses offered:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://learn.sba.gov/learning-center-plan/learning-center-how-to-write-a-business-plan#course-content">How to Write a Business Plan</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sba.gov/document/report--customer-service-plan">Customer Service</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sba.gov/media/training/sba_intro_to_acct_09012016/index.html">Introduction to Accounting</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Or, check out the free online courses at <a href="https://www.kutztown.edu/about-ku/administrative-offices/small-business-development-center/resources/free-online-learning-programs.html">Kutztown University</a>. Some of the courses we found most interesting and pertinent for real estate agents include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assessing Your Company&#8217;s Financial Needs</li>
<li>Managing your Cash Flow</li>
<li>Creating Financial Projections</li>
</ul>
<h2>Negotiate like a champ.</h2>
<p>Negotiation skills are an important aspect of being successful in real estate. You’ll find a list of online courses that will help you become a better negotiator and communicator (some provide certificates upon completion) from education giants such as <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/negotiation">Yale</a>, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/influencing-people">University of Michigan</a> and <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/understanding-arguments">Duke University</a>.</p>
<p>Sure, riparian rights and the different ways of holding title are important things to know for real estate agents and real estate school provides that knowledge.</p>
<p>But when it comes to running a small business, marketing your services and your clients’ listings, and negotiating on their behalf for the best deal, you’ll need to look elsewhere for knowledge.</p>
<p>Thankfully, you can find it online, in books, podcasts and videos. Now, you just need to find the time, right?</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/holes-in-real-estate-training/">Beyond Continuing Education: Holes in Real Estate Training</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>5 common time and resource wasters that hurt your real estate business</strong></h1>
<p>You know those days where you just can’t motivate yourself to be productive? Those days when Facebook or your favorite movie or video game screams louder than the pile of work in front of you?</p>
<p>I feel your pain. At least in my business, we have an excuse – we can just call it “writer’s block.” But not you, so when you waste time doing things that don’t make you money, the guilt starts stacking up and, if you waste too much time, your business suffers.</p>
<p>Self-discipline is the key; being able to push yourself even when you don’t feel like it is crucial.</p>
<p>The good news is that you can train yourself to be more disciplined and it starts by first recognizing the ways that you waste time and sabotage your success.</p>
<p><strong style="color: #333333; font-size: 26px;">1. Are you chronically disorganized?</strong></p>
<p>If you can’t find the scrap of paper that holds the contact info from your newest lead or you’re winging it when it comes to a marketing budget and your desk looks like a bomb went off on it, you’re probably chronically disorganized.</p>
<p>Every minute that you spend searching for something is a minute you could’ve spent being productive. It’s a minute wasted and at the end of the day, those minutes may add up to hours.</p>
<p>Disorganization leads to details falling through the cracks and missed deals due to a lack of follow-up. Time wasters are money wasters and represent money most agents would prefer to have in <em>their</em> bank accounts rather than their competition’s.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there are tools and systems to help you break the chaos habit. Chief among the tools is a <a href="/products/professional-for-agents/">CRM</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“The first reason you want a database or CRM platform is because your ability to make money is tied up in your ability to follow up with the people that you’re ultimately trying to serve.” &#8211; </strong> Business Coach <a href="https://travisrobertson.com/">Travis Robertson</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why bother generating leads if you aren’t able to effectively and consistently follow up with them to convert them to clients?</p>
<p>If you’re new to the business, a CRM should be the first tool you invest in for your business. Then, start loading it up with the names and contact information of everyone you know and everyone you meet.</p>
<p>Organize and categorize these contacts according to where they are in the <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/funnel1200.jpg">sales funnel</a> and set up systems to ensure you consistently follow up appropriately with each.</p>
<p><strong style="color: #333333; font-size: 26px;">2. Spending time on social media platforms that have little ROI</strong></p>
<p>Are you on Twitter because someone told you they get leads from it? How about Instagram? How much time do you spend making pretty posts for a platform that caters to the wrong demographics for real estate agents?</p>
<p>Stop wasting time on social media marketing platforms that return little on an agent’s time invested. Choose one or two that attract potential real estate consumers and learn how to dominate them.</p>
<p>The two with the most favorable demographics – those of the typical homebuyer and seller – are Facebook and LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Run some giveaways or contests on Facebook, join LinkedIn groups. But vow to only work on the platforms late in the day; make this marketing task the one you perform before you close up shop for the day.</p>
<p><strong style="color: #333333; font-size: 26px;">3. Being overly social when you should be working</strong></p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/Chart/Average-Time-Spent-per-Day-with-Facebook-Instagram-Snapchat-by-US-Adult-Users-of-Each-Platform-2015-2020-minutes/222515">eMarketer</a>, the average American over the age of 18 spends 40 minutes per day on Facebook.</p>
<p>That’s fine if those 40 minutes are personal minutes and you aren’t stealing them from your business. If social media starts taking time away from drumming up biz, however, it might be considered a waste of time.</p>
<p>And a money thief.</p>
<p>Check out page 22 of Market Leader’s oldie-but-still-goodie “<a href="http://files.marketleader.com/pdfs/TheCompleteGuide-to-RealEstateLeadGeneration.pdf">Complete Guide to Real Estate Lead Generation</a>” for tips on how to take control of your social media usage.</p>
<p><strong style="color: #333333; font-size: 26px;">4. Not setting boundaries</strong></p>
<p>Agents who work from home understand the temptations that await you every day. The Netflix movie you fell asleep in the middle of that you can’t wait to finish, the dishes piled in the sink and the laundry waiting to be folded – all of them beckon.</p>
<p>Those, however, are self-inflicted time wasters. The demands of other people are something all work-from-home agents must guard against.</p>
<p>Can you imagine calling a friend who works a 9-to-5 in an office, asking her to pick up your kids from school at 3 p.m.? Wouldn’t dream of it, right?</p>
<p>For some reason, many people feel that those of us who work from home aren’t <em>really</em> working. Your time is up for grabs. And far too many of us allow them to continue with this misconception, even giving in to it.</p>
<p>Setting clear boundaries is hard for some of us, but it can be learned. Practice if you must, but repeat after me:</p>
<p>“I’d love to help you but I’ll be working when [your flight arrives, your kids get out of school, your dog needs to go to the vet].</p>
<h2><strong>5. Choosing the wrong clients</strong></h2>
<p>In the beginning of your professional real estate life you’ll pretty much work with any buyer or seller who comes along. As time goes by, however, you should be able to recognize those clients who are guaranteed to be a time suck.</p>
<p>You know the ones: the buyers who have champagne tastes and beer pocketbooks, the sellers who insist on overpricing their homes.</p>
<p>They’ll suck weeks, maybe months of your time and, in the end, blame you that they didn’t get the mini-mansion for $200,000 or when you don’t bring in buyers for their unrealistically priced home.</p>
<p>The beauty of being in business for yourself is that you don’t have to work with any particular client. Pass the time wasters off to a colleague for a referral fee and free yourself to pursue better clients.</p>
<p>The best way to start getting rid of the time and resource wasters in your business is to take it one task at a time. Vow to get organized. When that’s accomplished, move on to tweaking your social media strategy or whatever else is most pressing.</p>
<p>Some of these time-wasting habits may take more time than others to banish, but if you concentrate on doing a little bit each day, before you know it, you’ll be a <em>former</em> time waster and one kick-butt productive real estate agent.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>A Simple Guide to Real Estate Yard Signs</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Are your real estate signs working as hard as they should?</strong></h2>
<p>Did you know that there is a “Standard Alphabets for Highway Signs” book? And, who knew that there exists in the U.S. the Foundation for the Advancement of the Sign Industry?</p>
<p>In fact, highway signage has a whole set of rules that we’re willing to wager few of agents consider when sticking for-sale real estate signs in a client’s lawn.</p>
<p>It only makes sense, however, when we <em>do</em> think about it. For the public’s safety, highway signs must be legible from certain distances.</p>
<p>For an entirely different reason, real estate signs also need to be legible from certain distances.</p>
<p>Here we are in 2019, well past the dawn of the digital age, and little has changed with real estate signage. They’re still stuck in the front yard or window of a home for sale, they still get muddy and many agents still make the same mistakes with them.</p>
<p>Of course, any discussion of real estate signage should be prefaced with the caveat that the majority of brokers and franchise owners dictate the use of their branded signs, so many agents don’t have a choice of what is on their real estate signs.</p>
<p>If you do have a choice, read on for information on how to make your real estate signs work hard to bring in buyers and, quite possibly generate additional real estate leads.</p>
<h2><strong>Remember the sign’s true purpose</strong></h2>
<p>One agent in a Facebook group brags that his signs are emblazoned with a very large copy of his logo. He loves the feedback he gets from the public.</p>
<p>“I get calls from people who say things like ‘I can’t turn in this town without seeing your sign.’”</p>
<p>It’s cool to get accolades from others, but the only accolades you should be aiming for with your real estate signs are those from your listing clients to all the folks they’ll be referring to your business.</p>
<p>And that won’t happen if your real estate signs are vanity signs.</p>
<p>Listing clients hire agents to market their homes for sale, not to market themselves. It’s dishonest to use your clients’ front yard to erect a monument to yourself.</p>
<p>A real estate sign’s main job is to clearly and concisely convey the listing agent’s contact information. And you can do so in a number of ways.</p>
<h2><strong>What color is your real estate sign? </strong></h2>
<p>“During the day, our eyes are most easily able to pick up green light, followed by yellow and blue,” according to April Sanders at Sciencing.com.</p>
<p>Red, on the other hand, is the least easy to view from a distance. At night, yellow is most visible.</p>
<p>So, what does this mean for real estate signs? No, we aren’t advocating you change your branding colors to suit your signage, but do consider that the phone number, the most important element of your sign, might look dashing in yellow against a green background.</p>
<h2><strong>Typography</strong></h2>
<p>One rule of thumb in the signage industry is that the individual letters on a real estate sign should measure 1 inch in height for every 30 feet in distance from the viewer.</p>
<p>“Thus, if a sign must be readable from 300 feet, its letters must be at least 10 inches tall,” according to Wade Swormstedt, executive director of the Foundation for the Advancement of the Sign Industry.</p>
<p>Since the widely accepted <a href="https://plannersweb.com/">width of a residential street</a>, from curb-to-curb, is 28 feet, the minimum height of the phone number on your sign should be 10 inches tall. That way, the family passing by on the other side of the street can see it.</p>
<p>For another take on letter height in signage, check out <a href="https://www.signazon.com/help-center/sign-letter-height-visibility-chart.aspx">this signage chart</a>.</p>
<p>It’s interesting how the digital age ushered in an attention to typography. Everyone has a favorite font, right?</p>
<p>The problem is that our favorites (give me Times New Roman any day) may not be the best to use in certain situations.</p>
<p>Take websites, for instance. Experts recommend Sans Serif fonts for online purposes (those without “<a href="https://www.awai.com/2011/10/the-best-fonts-to-use-in-print-online-and-email/">little feet and embellishments on the tip and base of each letter</a>,”) and Serif fonts for printed material.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-57505 size-full" src="https://www.marketleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Serif-Fonts.png" alt="serif font vs. sans serif font visual" width="589" height="195" /></p>
<p>Advertising legend David Ogilvy preferred the Century family, Caslon, Baskerville, and Jenson, according to Awai.com’s John Wood.</p>
<h3>The pros at landmarksigns.com suggest the following fonts:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Futura</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Garamond</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Helvetica</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Trajan</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Verdana</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your phone number is the most important element of your real estate sign’s lettering, so consider using what the highway sign experts use:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-57503 size-full" src="https://www.marketleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Highway-Gothic-vs.-Interstate-Fonts.png" alt="Highway Gothic Font vs. Interstate Font example" width="609" height="278" /></p>
<p>Since “better legibility is obtained by using a relatively wide spacing between letters,” according to the <a href="https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/shse/design.pdf">U.S. Department of Transportation</a>, the Interstate font seems to be the best choice.</p>
<p>Not all agents can choose their real estate signs. If you can, use the space wisely.</p>
<p>And, if you work under a broker who insists that the phone number on a real estate sign can’t be larger than the broker’s name, it’s time to strike out on your own.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/real-estate-yard-signs-what-where-and-why/">Real Estate Yard Signs: What, Where, and Why</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>How to utilize real estate mailers in 2019</strong></h1>
<p>While never completely “dead,” direct mail real estate marketing is seeing a resurgence. Experts chalk it up to the overuse of email marketing, but direct mail outperforms <em>most</em> digital marketing tactics, according to the <a href="https://thedma.org/marketing-insights/response-rate-report/">Association of National Advertisers</a> (ANA).</p>
<p>Direct mail marketing’s “response rate ranges from about five to nine times greater than that of email, paid search, or social media,” according to the pros at datatargetingsolutions.com.</p>
<p>Pretty impressive, right? Yet, at least in the real estate industry, it seems to be a very well-kept secret.</p>
<p>This leaves the door wide open for agents seeking an additional marketing vehicle and a way to stand out from the crowd.</p>
<h2><strong>People Trust Direct Mail</strong></h2>
<p>A couple of years ago, the folks at <a href="https://www.marketingsherpa.com/article/chart/channels-customers-trust-most-when-purchasing">MarketingSherpa.com</a> conducted a  study to determine “which advertising channels consumers trust most and least when making purchases.” The results are quite interesting:</p>
<div id="attachment_57359" style="width: 1148px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.marketingsherpa.com/article/chart/channels-customers-trust-most-when-purchasing"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-57359" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-57359 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Marketing-Sherpa-Chart.png" alt="Here’s a chart that suggests, in real estate, direct mail may be the most trusted advertising channel." width="1138" height="635" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-57359" class="wp-caption-text">Source: MarketingSherpa</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notice how all of the channels that have been pronounced “dead” top everything digital. Interestingly, 43 percent more of the respondents trust direct mail than Facebook and other social media ads.</p>
<p>Since trust is something high on the list of qualities that real estate consumers seek in an agent, maybe it’s time to add something “new” to the marketing mix.</p>
<h2><strong>Real Estate Mailers: What to Send</strong></h2>
<p>When I separate my mail every day, I put the garbage-looking mail in one pile and the stuff I’ll read in another. Every month I receive a market update from a real estate team here in town and that goes in the keep pile.</p>
<p>I enjoy learning what my home might be worth by comparing it to recently sold homes. I can’t for the life of me remember the couple’s name that sends me this report and I trash it after reading it.</p>
<p>Would I use them to sell my home? Never. Although I respect their consistency in mailing to me each month for the past three years, the report is ugly. It appears to be an Excel graph that they’ve reproduced on their office copier.</p>
<p>Sometimes they don’t even bother to center the paper in the copier and the image is crooked. It’s in black and white on flimsy paper.</p>
<p>In other words, if they put such little care into how they market themselves, I don’t think I’ll take a chance and hope that they’ll put more effort into marketing my home.</p>
<p>But they do get one thing right: they send it in a business-sized envelope without branding, and they send it consistently.</p>
<p>A recent ANA/DMA study of direct mail response rates finds that the old-fashioned business-sized envelope (also known as “letter-sized” and #10) “produced the best median response rate overall – 15.1%.”</p>
<p>Use these for your sales letters, newsletters and other items printed on paper. Don’t brand the envelopes; hand address each.</p>
<p>Yes, it sounds labor- and time-intensive, and it is. But if it increases the chance that recipients will open your mail, it’s worth all the time it takes.</p>
<h3><strong>Real Estate Postcards</strong></h3>
<p>Scientists at Temple University’s Fox School of Business, Center for Neural Decision Making and the U.S. Postal Service Office of Inspector General (OIG) teamed up to <a href="https://www.uspsoig.gov/sites/default/files/document-library-files/2015/rarc-wp-15-012.pdf">study</a> the circumstances under which email or direct mail was more effective.</p>
<p>Postcards were more effective in five of the nine tests performed.</p>
<p>If you include postcards in your real estate mailing campaign, choose unusual shapes and sizes to help them stand out in the pile of mail most of us receive.</p>
<p>Be aware, though, that these may cost more to mail than it does to send a standard postcard. “Generally, mailpieces [sic] that are 1/4-inch thick or less MUST be rectangular. Pieces more than 1/4-inch thick do not have to be rectangular,” to avoid increased cost, according to the <a href="https://pe.usps.com/businessmail101?ViewName=MailpieceShape">U.S. Postal Service</a>.</p>
<p>Use postcards with powerful images (local images if possible) and little text. The time-tested Just Listed and Just Sold postcards still work, but consider a postcard containing just your most compelling testimonial and contact information.</p>
<h4>Other ideas we’ve learned from agents who use direct mail include:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>An invitation to your event</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Invitation to an open house</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>A map of the recipients’ neighborhood, dotted with “pins” denoting recent listings and sales.</h5>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Real Estate Fliers</strong></h3>
<p>Consider oversized cards or even fliers with your message on one side and something of value to the recipient on the other. Here’s an example we found from <a href="https://kopywritingkourse.com/blog/">Kopywriting Kourse</a>&#8216;s website.</p>
<div id="attachment_57353" style="width: 387px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-57353" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-57353 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Flier-Front-Page.jpg" alt="Looking for real estate direct mail ideas? Try a flyer." width="377" height="494" /><p id="caption-attachment-57353" class="wp-caption-text">Flier Front</p></div>
<div id="attachment_57361" style="width: 394px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-57361" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-57361 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/flyer-back-page.jpg" alt="Real estate direct mail best practice: offer value" width="384" height="499" /><p id="caption-attachment-57361" class="wp-caption-text">Flier Back</p></div>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Although the first image (the front of the piece) is attractive, we think that the value offered (the event calendar on the back of the piece) should greet the recipient first. Put the salesy stuff on the back.</p>
<p>Consider creating cool, real estate-related infographic flyers. Here’s an example of a colorful, eye-catching, easy-to-read infographic, from Illinois Association of REALTORS®, using information they gleaned from Realtor.com.</p>
