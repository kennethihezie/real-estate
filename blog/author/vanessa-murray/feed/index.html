										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You may have heard about the destructive security bug, &#8220;Heartbleed,&#8221; that attacks a vulnerable flaw in major online security systems enabling it to access encrypted data. Warnings about Heartbleed are loud and alarming for good reason.</p>
<p>Please be assured, however: <strong>None of Market Leader&#8217;s systems have been affected by this security flaw. And none of the systems or services we provide to our customers or employees have been affected by this flaw.</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-29541" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Fotolia_63743415_S_copyright-150x160.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="160" />This doesn&#8217;t mean you should ignore the ever-increasing need for vigilance in protecting your data. The <a href="https://heartbleed.com/">Heartbleed Bug</a> launched about two years ago, and there&#8217;s no way for you to know what may have been compromised by this vulnerability, including Web, email, instant messaging, and some virtual private networks.</p>
<p>So we encourage you to practice good security measures, <strong>like remembering to change your online passwords. </strong>(Yea, yea, we know—it&#8217;s like hearing your dental hygienist reminding you to floss—but it&#8217;s gotta&#8217; be done!)</p>
<p><strong>Here are some excellent tips on protecting yourself and/or your brokerage</strong> along with links to more technical details and helpful information to use with your sphere of influence.</p>
<h2><strong>What can you do to protect yourself from Heartbleed?</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Change your passwords every few months. </strong>Especially passwords on financial accounts (banking, credit cards, etc.) and any site you regularly shop on. Before going to the trouble of changing all 250+ of your passwords, take a peek at the <a href="https://mashable.com/archive/heartbleed-bug-websites-affected">great list</a> Mashable.com put together to prioritize websites where you should consider changing your passwords.</li>
<li><strong>Be a little leery of public Wi-Fi networks.</strong> Your Internet behavior to non-transactional based or using websites that access financial information while on the Wi-Fi at Starbucks or other public places.</li>
<li><strong>If you have a VPN, use it. </strong>If your business or brokerage offers a virtual private network, or VPN, connect that way. It&#8217;s still fairly safe.<strong></strong></li>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t freak out. </strong>Sites like Amazon, Google, and other major Internet companies have already secured themselves and fixed the vulnerabilities disclosed this week. Still, changing your password is probably the best way to protect yourself and/or your business.</li>
<li><strong>Test to see which sites are vulnerable</strong>. Qualys® SSL Labs has created a Web app that will tell you what kind of encryption a site uses and whether the encryption is secure which can be found <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>What exactly is Heartbleed?</strong></h2>
<p>Heartbleed is a security flaw that was found on OpenSSL, a popular cryptographic library that is used to secure a huge chunk of the Internet&#8217;s traffic—basically any site that has “https” in the URL. Even if you have never heard of OpenSSL, chances are, it&#8217;s helped secure your data in some way.</p>
<h2><strong>How can you leverage this news with your contacts?   </strong></h2>
<p>As ActiveRain’s <a href="https://www.activerain.com/blogsview/4370309/heartbleed">Nikesh Parekh suggests</a>, blogging about the Heartbleed bug and sending an email to your contact database with a link to your blog post is a great opportunity to offer service to your prospects and customers.</p>
<h2><strong>Want more information about Heartbleed? Here are additional resources: </strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: small"><a href="https://mashable.com/archive/heartbleed-bug-websites-affected">Mashable.com’s list of web sites affected by Heartbleed</a></span></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On March 13, 2014, over 200 real estate professionals met in Tukwila, Wash., for REBarCamp (aka REBC) to spend the day making new connections, networking, listening, and learning from each other on how to master and grow their real estate businesses. The format and rules for the event were simple: share your advice, lean in, participate in conversations, no sales pitches or presentations, all thoughts and opinions are welcome, and utilize the “two-feet rule,” which means get up and walk out of the session if it doesn’t met your expectations or needs. And lastly, a reminder that this is an “unconference” – participants are to share and mastermind with attendees and walk home with actionable ideas.</p>
<p>Since it was my first time attending and the first time Market Leader was an event sponsor at a unconference of this nature, I was on the edge of my seat with excitement. Upon check-in, I wrote down a few topics on index cards that I wanted to learn more about and felt I could contribute to. But I didn’t know until the final agenda was posted which ones would make the list.</p>
<p>Once the agenda with room assignments was posted (see image to right), I realized I was in for a treat since many of my favorites made the list. Here are the big “a-has” that I walked home with from this event:</p>
<h2>#1: Develop a Strategic Social Media Plan</h2>
<p>You can’t reach an end goal unless you know where you currently stand. Same goes with growing your real estate practice. You must first develop a strategic plan that includes outlining and defining the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plan Goal(s)/Objective(s)</strong> – your business goals.</li>
<li><strong>Strategies</strong> – Outline the steps you’ll take to achieve your goals.</li>
<li><strong>Success Metrics</strong> – How will you measure your goals?</li>
<li><strong>Conduct a SWOT analysis of your current social media efforts</strong> – Outline strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats and/or benchmarks of other companies in your niche. Check out <a href="/blog/swot-analysis-for-real-estate-agents/">these tips for creating a real estate SWOT analysis</a> if you need help.</li>
<li><strong>Audience(s)</strong> – Identify your key target market.</li>
<li><strong>Core value messaging</strong> – Define your company’s mission statement, vision and core values*.</li>
<li><strong>Timing</strong> – Create an editorial calendar or approach to your plan.</li>
<li><strong>Action Plan</strong> – tactical steps.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #993300;">*Tip: Click</span> <a href="http://d11consulting.com/">here</a> <span style="color: #993300;">to download a free ebook, “Define Your Core Values,” by</span> <a href="https://twitter.com/debra11">Debra Trappen</a><span style="color: #993300;">.</span></span></em></p>
<h2><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft  wp-image-28991" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Agent-Fishing2-300x200.jpg" alt="Real estate agents use a lead generation solution to fish for leads " width="240" height="160" />#2: Learn to Fish Using Your Own Bait &amp; Strong Lures</h2>
<p>You’ve heard the Chinese Proverb: “Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.” Same goes with generating leads in real estate, you could fish on your own, but you’ll be more successful having the right tools in your tackle box.</p>
<p>One must learn how to attract and find online buyers and sellers and which tools to use to “hook” them as quickly as possible. As discussed at REBC, the secrets to catching or engaging an online lead include building <strong>TRUST</strong>, being <strong>RESPONSIVE</strong> preferably, being the first to respond to a lead within the first five minutes, and engaging your leads with listing alerts and campaigns using your business <strong>CORE VALUES</strong> in your marketing pieces, messaging, team culture and sales approach to attract your ideal target audience. You also want to be sure your bait is good – providing fresh, relevant <strong>CONTENT</strong> that pertains to your <strong>AUDIENCE</strong> will keep them coming back. Purchasing leads (aka lures) from companies like Trulia or Market Leader will provide you with opportunities and new leads to keep your sales pipeline full and teach you how to fish so your business is successful for a lifetime.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><em>Want to catch more fish? Download our free guide, “<a href="http://www.marketleader.com/landing/lead_generation_guide?lsr=AI-ROW-Organic-BLG-CompleteGuideToLeadGeneration&amp;del=CGLeadGeneration&amp;Brd=ROW&amp;Chl=Organic&amp;Cpgn=CompleteGuideToLeadGeneration&amp;SChl=BLG">Complete Guide to Lead Generation,</a>” to learn key strategies to generate more online leads.</em></span></p>
<h2>#3: Be Authentic &amp; Real</h2>
<p>People love stories. Marketing messages via storytelling is trending these days. Why? Consumers are more likely to purchase based on an emotional response. Four reasons consumers most likely don’t buy from you: no trust, no need, no money, or no urgency. Stories evoke emotion and build trust. Test different mediums to showcase your authentic self – use video to share a welcome message, write a blog that shares your insights and knowledge, use an e-newsletter to stay in touch with customers. Make it engaging and human. After all, you’re working with people.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><em>“People don&#8217;t buy what you do; they buy why you do it. And what you do simply proves what you believe.” ― Simon Sinek, author of “Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action”</em></span></p>
<h2>#4: It’s Not About YOU</h2>
<p>Don’t post an image of one of your current listings on your Facebook business page and expect your sphere of influence to like and share it. Instead, share stories, client testimonials or a link to a current real estate listing marketing video. The video can show how you hired a professional videographer, a drone, and professional actors – demonstrating your occupation as a Realtor®, your brand niche, your expertise and a taste of your passion.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><em>Tip: To WIN you’ve got to first GIVE. And Market Leader did just that by giving away a $50 Amazon gift card at this event. Congratulations again to <a href="https://twitter.com/seattlecondo">Ben Kakimoto</a> with Keller Williams Greater Seattle who was selected as our winner!</em></span></p>
<h2>#5: Be Purposeful With Prospecting</h2>
<p>Each social network has a different purpose and culture of socializing. The key to your success in growing fans and followers is to determine how to spin the same content for each platform that connects with your audience and initiates a conversation. Someone at <em>REBarCamp</em> described this well:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong> Facebook</strong> is for posting news about a family barbecue party, not for posting all the homes you sold last week or hope to sell next month.</li>
<li><strong> LinkedIn</strong> is for posting your resume, researching companies and networking, not for sharing your daughter’s dance recital photo.</li>
<li><strong> Google Plus</strong> is for building relationships, sharing knowledge, and building SEO.</li>
<li><strong> Pinterest</strong> is for building brand identity with the use of photos and images.</li>
</ul>
<h2>#6: Be Consistent</h2>
<p>It sounds rudimentary, but the key to any social media strategy is being consistent. Create an editorial calendar and action plan, and keep your content consistent. Start with just one channel and build upon that while staying true to the messaging you defined in your plan.</p>
<p><em>Have you attended a REBarCamp lately? If so, please share your insights in the comment section below. I look forward to fishing with you again very soon!</em></p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/takeaways-from-the-real-estate-barcamp-trenches-greater-seattle-2014/">Takeaways From the Real Estate BarCamp Trenches – Greater Seattle 2014</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-26711" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ebc29bb292a447cf9f50aba8d0795dab1-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />It is event season for all those who live and breathe real estate transactions. And you know what that means: busy airports, flight delays, crowded hotel lobbies, packed break-out sessions, noisy convention halls, sales pitches, late night networking parties, and much more that make your head spin, your toes cramp and your back ache.</p>
<p>So I ask: WHY go?</p>
<p>Here are my top reasons WHY going will positively change your life and real estate business:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-size: large"><strong>R</strong></span><span style="font-size: small">EAL CONNECTIONS</span></span></p>
<p>As I mentioned in a previous blog post on <a href="/blog/why-real-estate-conferences-conventions-are-important-for-business/">networking at conventions</a>, face-to-face connections are worth their weight in GOLD. Helping people and networking is your passion. Seeing old friends and meeting new ones is the joy of your profession. Pass your business card to a new associate and shake hands with a colleague who lives in Brazil. Trust me, those real conversations you have and real people you meet will help to grow your business two-fold. Your colleague in Brazil just might think of you the next time he has the perfect client who wants to move to Denver.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small"><strong><span style="font-size: large">E</span></strong>DUCATION</span></p>
<p>RE/MAX® International Inc. has rolled out the red carpet again this year with an outstanding lineup of nationally recognized speakers, authors, celebrity athletes, heroes, fellow colleagues and business consultants. Some must-sees include: RE/MAX Technology Director Jeb Griffin (@JebGriffin), social media consultant Katie Lance (@KatieLance), Charis Moreno from Trulia (@TruliaPro), Steve Murray from REAL Trends (@StephenHMurray), Valerie Garcia from RE/MAX® Ontario (@Valeriegarcia1), and Bob Stewart from ActiveRain (@ActiveBob).</p>
<p>Learn from the best. Attend break-out sessions. Visit the <strong>RE/MAX Approved Supplier MarketPlace</strong>. Download the RE/MAX R4 Convention App. Ask questions. Watch demos. Go to workshops. Read the brochures. Listen to vendors. Challenge them to show you how their solution will help you succeed in real estate. Get there early, get educated and you’ll get results.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small"><span style="font-size: large"><strong>M</strong></span>OTIVATION</span></p>
<p>Over 4,000 fellow RE/MAX® agents and brokers from around the WORLD will be in attendance this year at the <strong>R4 convention (#remaxR4)</strong>. It’s exciting to know that you’re part of what makes the RE/MAX brand so strong. Listen to the leaders like Darren Hardy (@DARRENHARDY), the Publisher and Founding Director of SUCCESS magazine, and Simon Sinek (@simonsinek), who wrote “Leaders Eat Last” and “Start with WHY,” on how to succeed in business and grow teams. They will inspire you, push you and move you to expect more out of yourself. People like basketball league Earvin “Magic” Johnson (@MagicJohnson) and financial editor for NBC’s “Today” show, Jean Chatzky (@JeanChatzky), will make a difference. And those are just a few of the many speakers who will be participating. Be there, be present, and be ready to be inspired.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small"><strong><span style="font-size: large">A</span></strong>CCELERATE PROFITS</span></p>
<p>Don’t forget your ABCs: Always be closing. Remember, you’re there for business. Learn which online tools and technology will accelerate your real estate sales and make your brokerage profitable. Listen to your leaders and your peers, including real estate broker Nina Hollander from RE/MAX Executive Realty in Charlotte, N.C., who will be sharing her secrets to online leads at the Market Leader booth #123. Come by and join Market Leader’s <a href="https://learn.marketleader.com/display/coaching/Million+Dollar+Pipeline+Program">Million Dollar Pipeline Program</a>. Wake up early and don’t miss the chance to accelerate your profits in 2014!</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large"><strong>X</strong></span><span style="font-size: small">TREME FUN</span></p>
<p>Come on folks, we’re talking sin city, where “what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.” The Mandalay Bay hotel is gorgeous, and if the weather is warm, they might even open the pool for you. But if not, you can have fun shopping, walking down the strip, riding the roller coaster at night (no, you’re not too old), or simply spending time with colleagues and vendors. R4 wraps up with a party and concert you won’t want to miss, thanks to Keith Urban (@KeithUrban), country singer superstar. So grab your comfy shoes and have FUN!</p>
<p>If you are attending RE/MAX R4 convention this year, I’d love to hear your feedback and key takeaways!</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/remax-r4-convention-2014-why-go/">RE/MAX R4 Convention 2014: WHY Go?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

I’m a little jealous that several of my event marketing peeps, like Alex Allison with Dot Loop and Dan Stewart of Happy Grasshopper, are in New York City this week attending one of the most influential real estate industry events of the year, Real Estate Connect New York City, hosted by Inman News. Not only is NYC one of my favorite cities to visit, but Inman Connect stays true to its name. It’s all about bringing the smartest, most talented speakers and technology gurus within the real estate industry together to connect and inspire. (If you want to learn the true value of this, read my blog post on why <a href="/blog/why-real-estate-conferences-conventions-are-important-for-business/">real estate industry events</a> are important for business.)</p>
<p>Attendees will get to hang out with Katie Lance and Chris Smith from Inman News, two of my favorite peeps within the industry. The <a href="https://events.inman.com/inman-connect-new-york">agenda</a> at Real Estate Connect New York City is packed with outstanding topics and sessions. If you’re looking to extend your business trip over the weekend, here are a few of my travel tips to New York City. This list is compiled from several emails from friends and family members who live in the Big Apple, so it’s sure to be worth the read or another visit!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The cocktail parties, the dining and dancing, and the networking that goes on at the typical real estate convention or conference may all seem pretty frivolous, but the return on your investment for attending is higher than you may think.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8501" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Fotolia_28476260_XS-300x230.jpg" alt="real estate conferences and conventions" width="300" height="230" />You’re forging bonds with other agents from around the world &#8211; agents you can refer clients to and obtain referrals from in return. You’re also getting access to hands-on training, top-notch thought leaders and business strategies that can make for smoother (and more frequent) transactions in the future.</p>
<p>After a full year of managing hundreds of events, rubbing shoulders with the best of the best speakers and attending several of the real estate industry’s top events, I see three main benefits to attending conferences and conventions:</p>
<h2>Education</h2>
<p>On the more serious side of real estate conferences are the phenomenal educational opportunities offered through workshops and lectures. Trainers, nationally renowned speakers, thought leaders, and top industry experts offer timely information on topics and issues that are valuable to agents, brokers and team leads. If you were to obtain the same training outside industry sponsored conventions, you’d pay hundreds if not thousands to get access to this information. Not to mention that the trade exhibit halls are packed with new technology and vendors offering ways to make your business run smoother and smarter.</p>
<p>Here at Market Leader, we offer weekly <a href="http://www.marketleader.com/best-practices">Power Hours</a> – webinars that attract thousands of agents every week. While the topics are timely and valuable (ideas to help you stand out in 2013 and business planning strategies, for instance), some people don’t learn well by listening – they need live training so they can pick up on body language and inflection. Live training forces you to focus on the speaker, so there are fewer distractions than when you’re listening to a webinar in your office.</p>
<h2>Engagement</h2>
<p>The trade expos at conferences and conventions offer a double bonus. Aside from what we can learn from the vendors, they offer engagement with these key partners to your business: sign companies, closing gift companies, photographers, office supply, insurance, mortgage lenders, coaches, email marketing, lead generation, contact management, transaction management, and technology solution-based companies galore. All of which most likely have great giveaways to encourage conversations (new iPad mini anyone?). How much is a conversation worth to your business?</p>
<p>Then, there’s the engagement with your colleagues. It’s a lot easier to forge and build relationships when you’re given the opportunity to engage with other agents and vendors outside of work. The relationship blossoms when you meet these people face to face, exchange business cards, attend a breakout session, and spend time socializing with them. It’s a bit like a real estate transaction in that, at the end of the day, it’s a handshake.</p>
<p>So, one of the most important benefits I took away from a recent conference is realizing that we all need human contact, we need validation, and we find both in the camaraderie at conventions and conferences.</p>
<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>We all like to be inspired, and a lot of what we hear at these events inspires us to excellence; it reminds us to stay ahead of the curve and to remain competitive.</p>
<p>If I attend a lecture and a leader in the industry is talking about how she became wildly successful, you can bet I’m going to consider modeling her methods. At the very least, I’m inspired to be open to new ideas and new ways of doing things.</p>
<p>At many of this year’s conferences, I was also able to better understand competitors, what they were doing and what they bring to the table. Competition is good and healthy in all aspects. From business to professional and personal growth, it encourages us to better our game and drill down our own UVPs (unique value propositions).</p>
<p>We all know that we should always treat our businesses as a business, and every good business person understands the value of an annual review. Conventions and conferences offer an opportunity to review what’s working and what’s not in your real estate business. Sure, they can be pricey, but it’s important to invest the time and money to attend at least one conference or convention a year. You owe it to your business.</p>
<p>If you attended any conferences, conventions, or trade shows this year, I’d love to hear which ones were your favorites and key takeaways.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/why-real-estate-conferences-conventions-are-important-for-business/">Why Real Estate Conferences & Conventions Are Important for Your Business</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7321" style="margin: 5px" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/realtors-night-out-300x300.jpg" alt="NAR REALTORS night out" width="300" height="300" />“Discover Your Magic” is the theme of this year’s NAR convention, and the name only hints at what awaits Realtors®. Your friends at Market Leader are among the 400 industry vendors at the Orange County Convention Center in Orlando, Fla. The energy in this place is amazing!</p>
<p>Friday was Realtor® Spirit Day in case you were wondering why everyone was decked out in their company t-shirts. There was also a full slate of workshops – everything from Top Tools for Global Professionals to a property management forum and a workshop on selling luxury properties. There were definitely lots of good educational opportunities for agents.</p>
<p>So, yes, the conference offers you a chance to catch up with issues that affect your business, and you can tell your broker you’re here to continue your “professional development,” but we know most of us come here for the swag, and there’s a ton of it.</p>
<p>Realtors® from all over the world are stopping by the Market Leader booth (number 2181, toward the northeast part of the convention center) to test their luck at our “Unlock an iPad” contest. Yup, we’re giving away iPads. You can check one out in the glass jeweler’s case at our booth. Stick your hand into the fishbowl full of keys, pull one out, and if it unlocks the case, you walk with a brand new iPad!</p>
<p>Wells Fargo has a fabulous booth with phenomenal attendance. It could be that there’s horse racing there. I kind of have a feeling, though, that the fact that they’re giving away a Chrysler 300C has a lot to do with all the Realtors® hanging around Booth 1151. Good luck to all who enter!</p>
<h2>Vanessa’s Fave-Booth-of-the-Day</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7291" style="margin: 5px 10px" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/NAR-2012-booth-car-300x300.jpg" alt="NAR 2012 booth car" width="300" height="300" />DotLoop (booth 2065), with its “Back to the Future” theme, including the flux capacitored, stress-ball-filled DeLorean is my pick for Booth-of-the-Day. Be sure and stop by &#8211; they’re giving away t-shirts and other fun stuff.</p>
<p>Last night we headed out for Realtor®’s Night Out at Universal’s Islands of Adventure. The park was closed to all but Realtors® and their families &#8211; what a great treat. The perks that come with this great educational conference are amazing.</p>
<p>Today we open the Market Leader booth at 9 a.m. and the first 25 people who mention they read this blog post will win a $5 Starbucks gift certificate, so come on by!</p>
<h2>Vanessa’s NAR Conference and Expo Tip of the Day:</h2>
<p>Exit Realty (booth 703, in the southwest corner of the convention center) is giving away huge carry bags. They’re roomy enough to hold all the swag you pick up as you stroll through the expo.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/your-daily-cheat-sheet-to-the-2012-nar-conference-and-expo/">Your Daily Cheat Sheet for the 2012 NAR Conference and Expo</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>
