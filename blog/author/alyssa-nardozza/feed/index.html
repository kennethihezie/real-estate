										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a recent survey called <a href="/blog/the-happiest-agent-on-the-block/">“The Happiest Agent on the Block,”</a> Market Leader asked over 3,000 real estate agents about how happy they are with their real estate careers, incomes, tasks they complete on a day-to-day basis, and life in general. Our analysis of the survey results revealed some interesting facts about the habits and traits of happy agents, offering insight into who agents are as people, not just professionals.</p>
<h2>1. You&#8217;re Married</h2>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/tumblr_mr862tITZU1soja0jo1_500.gif" alt="Married" /></p>
<p>Married agents tend to be happy agents. The “Happiest Agent on the Block” survey revealed that married agents are more likely to be happy than single agents, especially those that have never tied the knot.</p>
<p>The positive correlation between marriage and happiness in the real estate industry is <a href="https://freakonomics.com/podcast/why-marry-part-1-a-new-freakonomics-radio-podcast/">also found in the rest of the U.S.</a> Both of these correlations are mostly due to the fact that married people also possess qualities that are conducive for their happiness (e.g., they have good health, active social lives, and steady employment).</p>
<h2>2. You Use an iPad</h2>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/dogipad.gif" alt="dog ipad" /></p>
<p>Real estate agents who use iPads are more likely be happy with their careers than agents who use Android tablets like the Samsung Galaxy Tab (although both groups are more likely to be happy than agents who do not use tablets at all).</p>
<p>Other popular Apple products also seem to impact happiness. Agents who use iPhones and Mac computers are more likely to be happy with their real estate careers than agents who use Android phones and PCs. It is possible that agents who use Apple products perceive themselves as being more happy than they really are thanks to Apple’s hip, youth-oriented marketing campaigns.</p>
<h2>3. You Wake Up Early</h2>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/cat-wake-up.gif" alt="cat waking you up" /></p>
<p>The adages “the early bird gets the worm” and “early to bed and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise” both apply to the real estate industry. The earlier an agent goes to bed at night and wakes up each morning, the more likely he is to be happy with his real estate career. We found that agents who go to bed between 8 and 10 p.m. and wake up before 6 a.m. are most likely to be happy with their careers.</p>
<h2>4. You Enjoy Meeting New People</h2>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/meeting-new-people.gif" alt="meeting new people" /></p>
<p>Of all the reasons real estate agents had for joining the industry, those who were interested in meeting new people are the most likely to now be happy with their careers. This isn’t surprising given that many day-to-day tasks, like following up with leads and going to client appointments, involve networking with new people.</p>
<h2>5. You Make Bank!</h2>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/tumblr_mlom9lWR6h1qjfaqjo1_500.gif" alt="money" /></p>
<p>Of all the agent habits and traits touched on in the “Happiest Agent on the Block” survey, commission income had perhaps the most direct correlation with agent happiness. Simply put, the more money agents make, the more likely they are to be happy with their real estate careers. Agents who made over $150,000 in commission income in 2013 are a whopping 37 percent more likely to be happy with their careers than agents who made less than $10,000 that year!</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/5-signs-you-are-a-happy-agent/">5 Signs You Are a Happy Agent</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-29231" title="Marketing Concept" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Fotolia_59082866_XS-300x191.jpg" alt="MarketMix 2014 Marketing Conference" width="300" height="191" /></p>
<p>Last week the marketing managers from Market Leader went to a local conference called <a> MarketMix 2014</a>. This daylong event was put on by the local chapter of the American Ma<br />
rketing Association. The event had a lot of great speakers and insights, and while the tips offered were not necessarily from the real estate industry, we translated them to help your real estate business.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at three key insights from the conference.</p>
<h2>1. Be Able to Answer: Why Does My Business Exist?</h2>
<p>In the session presented by Andrew Sherrard, senior vice president of marketing at T-Mobile, we learned that T-Mobile completely rethought their overall strategy. They wondered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why do we exist?</li>
<li>Would anyone miss us?</li>
<li>Would anyone create a similar company to us?</li>
<li>What do people like or not like about our business?</li>
</ul>
<p>After answering those questions, T-Mobile changed its marketing, product plans and fees to reflect a new philosophy of “fair, simple, great value, and customer-focused” which led to their “Un-carrier” campaign.</p>
<h3>Sure, that’s great, but how does this relate to real estate?</h3>
<p>Before starting your marketing plan, it is best to first figure out why your business exists. What is the mission statement for your business? For example, “My business exists to help residents in my community find their ‘comfort zone’ (aka new home).” What is your value proposition, or summary of all the benefits you provide to homebuyers and sellers? In other words, why should they choose you instead of the agent down the street?</p>
<p>Being able to answer these questions is a crucial step in developing your unique selling points, and your ability to convert your leads into clients. As you contemplate what distinguishes you from other agents and why your business exists, your goal should be to stand out to potential clients. Think about what would appeal to potential buyers.<br />
Some ideas to stand out:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Do you respond quickly? Many homebuyers complain that agents are hard to get ahold of. Is that you, or do you respond to all communications within five minutes?</li>
<li>Do you have special offers, such as a home-buying guide, home warranty, or home staging services?</li>
<li>Are you an area expert?</li>
<li>Are you a specialist with a certain type of homebuyer, such as first-time homebuyers, veterans, or international buyers?</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>After you have come up with your selling points, use them in your marketing and when you speak to potential customers. This should help you convert more leads to clients.</p>
<h2>2. Personalize Your Marketing to Your Leads</h2>
<p>Another session Market Leader attended was “Seven Technology Trends” with the director of marketing and personalization technology from Nordstrom. There were seven technology trends to pay attention to, including facial recognition, marketing profiles, wearables, data experimentation, triggered automation, and content automation, but the most relevant one to agents was personalization. Using behavioral data to create profiles is the new way of marketing. For instance, tracking what your audience is doing when they interact with you, including pages visited, clicks, apps used, emails read, or social interactions.</p>
<p>Personalizing your marketing to your audience is key. In retail, which email do you think is more likely to get customers to buy shoes, one that shows similar shoes to those they viewed on a retail site, or an email showing a selection of random shoes? It should be obvious that the email with similar shoes is likely to have a better outcome. In fact, Nordstrom mentioned that 41 percent of consumers buy more from retailers who provide personalized emails.</p>
<h3>How does this relate to real estate?</h3>
<p>This is directly applicable to how you should think about your leads and emails. Segment your leads by their behavior on your website. Your emails should be targeted to a lead’s interest. A buyer who is looking at all single-family homes in a suburb probably would not be interested in a listing alert for condos in the city. Make sure your listing alerts match a lead’s search history on your site. By sending personalized relevant messages, you will better engage your leads and make your emails a resource, instead of an annoyance.</p>
<h2>3. Believe in the Impossible</h2>
<p>We got inspiration from the session with Liftport Lunar Space Elevator.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a profound difference between difficult, very very hard, and impossible,&#8221; according to Michael Laine. He is building an elevator from the moon into space, which might seem impossible, but his company is making it possible and is on track to be operational by 2020.</p>
<p>In other words, aim high and not just say something is impossible. Don’t take no for an answer. Instead, create a goal for your business that you believe is almost impossible, and create a plan to get there. Also called a “vision statement,” this should be the best possible outcome of all your hard work. You might aim to be a millionaire, or double your monthly transactions, or to reach whatever goal will push your business to another level.</p>
<p>That is how you grow your career and accomplish more then you thought possible.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/marketing-tips-from-marketmix-2014/">Marketing Tips From MarketMix 2014</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-27481" title="3 Stats to Evaluate Your Email Marketing" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Fotolia_58744078_XS-300x300.jpg" alt="Email is a great marketing tool for real estate agents, but it's important to follow certain stats to ensure your emails are helping turn leads into clients" width="300" height="300" />You probably already use email to communicate with your leads and clients. But do you know how your emails are performing? Are you sending the right message to your leads? Are they even reading your emails?</p>
<p>As with any investment, you need to measure your ROI. In the case of email marketing, the main cost is the time you’re investing, but you still need to make sure you’re getting a good return. As your database of leads grow, email marketing is a great way to automate some of your communication and stay in touch in a meaningful way. But you want to make sure your emails are being read and helping your leads to become your clients.</p>
<p>Don’t worry &#8211; you don’t have to spend tons of time with metrics to evaluate your email. By simply tracking three metrics, you can get a good sense of your email ROI:</p>
<h2>1. Open Rate</h2>
<p><strong></strong>This is the percentage of prospects that open your emails. This percentage tells you how many people viewed and potentially read your email. The subject line of an email and how often you send emails to your contacts heavily influence open rates. If you send too many emails, especially when the content and subject lines are not interesting to your audience, the open rate will be low.</p>
<p><strong>Ways to improve open rate: </strong>Focus on <a href="/blog/dont-let-your-real-estate-newsletters-end-up-in-the-trash/">subject lines</a> and content that is relevant and interesting to your audience. For example, a first-time homebuyer is not likely to be interested in home staging tips. Listings appeal to buyers and sellers, but make sure the listings you send are relevant to your leads based on the searches they did on your site. Subject lines should pique readers’ interest and describe the content of the email, but don’t let it get too long. Limit the subject line to less than 150 characters.</p>
<h2>2. Click-Through Rate</h2>
<p><strong></strong>The CTR is the percentage of prospects that click through your email to whatever content you’re promoting (your blog, a featured listing, etc.). In order to track this metric, you will need to include a clickable link in all your emails. This is a best practice to ensure your leads are interacting with you and your website, instead of going elsewhere.</p>
<p>Click-through rate is an important metric to track because it measures what percentage of the total audience is consuming your content. This lets you know if the people who opened your email found it interesting enough to continue on to your site.</p>
<p><strong>Way to improve CTR:</strong> Include a link to your website in all emails. Segmenting your lead database according to their interests and interactions, and then sending targeted messages to each segment is the best way to increase click-through rate. This will ensure that relevant content reaches the prospects that find it most interesting.</p>
<h2>3. Conversions</h2>
<p><strong></strong>This refers to the number of people that do the call to action from your email. The conversion rate is a percentage of people that complete the conversion action. For example, if you send a link to listings, a conversion could be saving the listing or replying to ask for more information. If you send a link to a blog article, a conversion could be viewing additional blog posts or signing up for your newsletter. Conversions are the goal of your email. Tracking them will let you know if people are responding to your emails with the actions you would like.</p>
<p><strong>Ways to improve conversions: </strong>The best way to improve conversions is to have a clear call to action for your email. Tell your audience what you would like them to do and how to do it. Provide links to direct readers right to the content you would like them to see, and make the process to complete the conversion as simple as possible. If your conversion rate isn’t good, make sure your website landing page (the part of the site you linked to in your email) also displays the call to action clearly and that it can be completed easily.</p>
<p>By taking a look at whether people are opening your emails, clicking through to your website, or completing your desired conversion, you can determine how effective your email campaigns are. This will help identify which leads are interacting the most with your email and site.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/3-stats-to-evaluate-your-email-effectiveness/">3 Stats to Evaluate Your Email Effectiveness</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-22861 size-medium" title="What is IDX and How Can it Help Generate Leads?" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Fotolia_32837387_XS-300x190.jpg" alt="Learn how IDX real estate listings can be a powerful way to elevate your website marketing." width="300" height="190" />If you have a website that displays listings, chances are you are using an IDX feed to get listings on your website. IDX stands for Internet Data Exchange and is how the MLS shares listing data among its members. Since it is all about sharing listings, IDX is also sometimes known as “Broker Reciprocity.”</p>
<p>IDX enables all active listings in the MLS to be shared between MLS members and displayed on the websites of MLS participants (agents and brokers). IDX was created to make sure all MLS members have equal information to all MLS listings. Each MLS has policies in place for their IDX feed designed to make sure no one user has any unfair advantage and that all listings are available to the participants.</p>
<p>While the IDX feeds are designed to give all MLS members equal access to listings information, not all IDX websites are created equal. The website functionality of an IDX feed can make all the difference between having a website that generates business and one that doesn’t.</p>
<h2>What is Your Site For?</h2>
<p>The vast majority of agents say the main purpose of their website is generating leads. If this is your goal, effective lead generation campaigns rely on content that gives your target audience what they want. The purpose of a real estate agent’s website should be to appeal to potential homebuyers and sellers in order to generate leads.</p>
<p>So what are homebuyers and sellers looking for online?</p>
<p>Homebuyers simply want to look at listings. Potential sellers also often want to look at listings to check out the competition for their home. And, since many sellers are buyers too, they may be looking for a new home to buy. That’s what an IDX feed on your website is for &#8211; to give these searchers what they are looking for: listings.</p>
<h2>What do Effective IDX Websites Have?</h2>
<p>An IDX website is a must for lead generation, but to get those leads you will need features that will make your IDX website into a business generator. Make sure your IDX website has:</p>
<p><strong>1. Easy Navigation/Search &#8211;</strong> Make sure that website visitors are able to find the listings they want. Your IDX website should have simple search filters to help users get to the listings that meet their criteria. If your site doesn’t make it easy for visitors to find what they want, they will leave and find the listings elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>2. Lead Capture &#8211;</strong> The goal of the IDX website is generating leads, so you better make sure your IDX website has an optimized lead capture system. This is something we are experts on at Market Leader. We are constantly testing and improving our lead capture to get the most leads for our customers. Some best practices for lead capture that we have learned include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prompt the visitor to register.</strong> Don’t just wait for them to choose to register.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Make the registration page as simple as possible.</strong> The more information you ask for and the harder you make it for a visitor to fill out the form, the lower the conversion rate and fewer leads you have to work with.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use a two-step form.</strong> If you want to ask for more information, request an email and name first and then add a second step to ask for further information.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Include a meaningful call to action.</strong> Don’t just tell them to give you their contact information; make sure they get something out of it and let them know the advantages of registering, such as complete access to listings, ability to save favorites, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Automated Listing Alerts &#8211;</strong> Automated listings alerts from your IDX website that are relevant to the listings visitors have been looking at are a great way to make sure they come back to your site, helping convert visitors from leads to clients.</p>
<p><strong>4. An Integrated CRM &#8211;</strong> Having an integrated CRM (Customer Relationship Management) allows you to keep track of what your leads are doing on your website as well as your communications with them. This will help you better prioritize your leads and keep in contact with them when they are ready to transact.</p>
<p>An effective website is an important tool for getting leads online &#8211; make sure your site is set up for success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-20781" title="How to Automate Without Sounding Like a Robot" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Fotolia_35409514_XS-300x262.jpg" alt="Automating tasks will save real estate agents time, but providing good customer service requires a human element" width="300" height="262" />The object of the real estate agent game is to fit as many tasks as possible into a finite amount of time. From lead generation and follow-up to coordinating transactions, that’s a lot of tasks. Thankfully, many of them can be either delegated or automated, freeing up time for you to do the things you do best.</p>
<p>Hiring the right people to pick up some of these tasks is a challenge unto itself. Automating certain duties is easy; doing so while maintaining the human element is a bit harder, and many agents end up utterly failing.</p>
<p>Palm Beach real estate agent Paul Schafranic tells the story of a European client who emailed five real estate agents regarding his desire to purchase property in the area. All but one of them sent automated responses that sounded, well, automated.</p>
<p>A month later, when the client was due to roll into town to make the purchase, Schafranic &#8211; the one out of the five who personalized his response &#8211; was his agent and assisted him in the purchase of a $4 million home.</p>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with automating as many of your systems as possible. What is unforgiveable, however, is sounding like a robot. If you don’t want to lose buyers and listings, read on.</p>
<h2>Lead Generation</h2>
<p>Lead generation is a necessary evil if you hope to remain in the real estate business. The good news is that there is an easy way to do this: Buy Internet leads.</p>
<p>Staci Dancey, an agent with Surterre Properties in Newport Beach, Calif., automated her lead generation efforts by buying leads and sold $24 million in real estate in one year.</p>
<p>“I was able to work Monday through Thursday, and I was still one of the top producing agents in the area,” she said. “That success came from the fact that I wasn’t spending time generating new leads &#8211; they were coming to me.”</p>
<p>Since 94 percent of buyers ranked responsiveness as a “very important,” agent quality, according to the National Association of Realtors®, follow-up is the key to converting these leads into sales.</p>
<p>It’s challenging to reach out to leads immediately, but the sooner you do so the better your chances of making contact. In fact, NAR says that the odds of connecting with a lead increase 100 times if the attempt is made within five minutes instead of 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Avoid the robotic email on this first reach-out. Pick up the phone and touch bases with the lead.</p>
<h2>Delegate Tasks</h2>
<p>Hire an assistant to reach out and call your leads, keeping in mind that a licensed assistant can answer more questions than one who isn’t licensed. Either way, train your assistant on how to qualify leads and the importance of immediate follow-up.</p>
<p>Training is everything when it comes to your staff. Ensure that the person is professional yet personable and knows exactly what type of lead should be transferred to you immediately.</p>
<h2>Listings Alerts</h2>
<p>A listing alert is an automatic email notifying a contact of new listings that match the search criteria that the contact provides. Listing alerts are designed to keep your contacts coming back to your website frequently.</p>
<p>Market Leader has found that the more contacts you have who receive listing alerts, the more returning visitors you have to your website. The more returning visitors you have, the more likely you are to get a phone call when a contact finds his or her ideal home.</p>
<p>To set up this system, you’ll need to have software tied into your MLS. Market Leader software has listings alerts built into the website and CRM. The beauty of this system is that your leads can set up and edit their listing alerts as their criteria evolve.</p>
<p>Listing alerts by their very nature run the danger of making you seem robotic. To avoid this, ensure that your listing alert service is customizable so that the alerts appear to be coming from you.</p>
<p>Next, personalize the message so that it sounds more like your voice. Don’t forget to add an email signature.</p>
<h2>Email Marketing</h2>
<p>“I was able to set up mass emails in my Market Leader Professional system and make them appear as if they were individual,” said Danci. “It continues to work beautifully.”</p>
<p>Not all the leads you receive are ready to transact right away, so email marketing helps you stay in touch until they are ready.</p>
<p>Use email marketing software to send emails automatically, based on the schedule you desire, from every few days to every few months. The Market Leader system does this, and it is built-in with website and contacts, making it easy.</p>
<p>If the lead communicates back to you, turn off the drip email and respond by phone.</p>
<p>If you are using templates, personalize them.</p>
<h2>When Not to Automate</h2>
<p>While having the proper systems and tools in place and automating as much as you can frees you up for more important tasks, some things require the personal touch. To ensure you are providing quality <a href="/blog/how-to-provide-great-customer-service/">customer service</a>, do not automate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your replies to leads that have contacted you.</li>
<li>Phone calls.</li>
<li>Buyer and agent feedback.</li>
</ul>
<p>The best way to avoid sounding robotic is to have a voice and not be afraid to use it. “Everyone hates automated phone systems, so why would they want to read the digital equivalent of the same thing?” asks Chelsey Yearin at Social Media Contractors. “Sounding human will at least make people want to interact with you,” she continues, “and your company&#8217;s voice is as much a part of your brand as anything else.”</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/how-to-automate-without-sounding-like-a-robot/">How to Automate Without Sounding Like a Robot</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-20421" title="Creating a Business Plan for 2014" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Fotolia_53597186_XS-300x216.jpg" alt="Is your real estate business ready for 2014? It's time to evaluate strengths and weaknesses and create a plan for success in the coming year" width="300" height="216" />It might only be early November, but 2014 will be here before you know it, and it isn’t too early to start planning. To help agents prepare for 2014, Market Leader has just released the <a href="http://success.marketleader.com/2014BusinessPlan?lsr=AI-ROW-BLG-2014RealEstateBizPlan-DustinR&amp;del=2014BizPlan">2014 Real Estate Business Plan</a>.</p>
<p>This year’s business plan gives you predictions for the 2014 real estate market, tests you on your strengths and weaknesses, and is jam-packed with worksheets to help you make 2014 the best year yet for your business. Let’s take a peek at what you will learn in this year’s guide.</p>
<h2>How was 2013?</h2>
<p>Before you set out to plan for 2014, the first step is to review 2013. Figure out what went right, what went wrong, and identify your strengths and weaknesses. A SWOT Analysis (Strength, Weakness, Opportunities, and Threats) is a great tool to identify places for improvement.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Where have you succeeded in 2013?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Where have you not done well in 2013?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Opportunities:</strong> Things that you haven’t exploited in 2013 that can be to your advantage in 2014.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Threats:</strong> Potential issues that might cause problems for your business.</li>
</ul>
<p>Strengths and weaknesses represent how you are performing – the areas in which you are succeeding or need improvement. Opportunities and threats are external factors that impact your business. Some examples of opportunities or threats for the real estate agent would be how the real estate market is doing, agent competitors, and new technologies for agents such as CRM and marketing software.</p>
<p>The 2014 business plan includes a test to help identify your internal strengths and weaknesses in four key business areas:</p>
<p><strong>1. Lead Generation:</strong> Leads are the fuel in your real estate business. Without enough leads, your business won’t be going anywhere. Is the number of leads you generated in 2013 a strength or weakness?</p>
<p><strong>2. Lead Engagement:</strong> Once you have your leads, do you know what to do with them? Engaging leads and following up with them effectively is important for turning leads into clients. Is your lead engagement a strength or weakness?</p>
<p><strong>3. Marketing/Branding:</strong> People won’t magically know about you and your business. How well are you promoting yourself in your community and online? Have you established a brand? Is your marketing a strength or weakness?</p>
<p><strong>4. Referrals:</strong> Referrals are the best leads and are vital to building a successful business. Is getting referrals a strength or weakness?</p>
<p>The business plan will also help you identify opportunities and threats by sharing where the real estate market is headed in 2014.</p>
<h2>Market Outlook for 2014</h2>
<p>In October 2013, Market Leader had a live video conference with Jed Kolko, chief economist at Trulia, about the state of the current market and where he thinks we’re headed in 2014. While he doesn’t have a crystal ball, he can o¬ffer industry expertise to help you plan for success next year.</p>
<p>In 2014, Jeff Kolko predicts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interest rates and home prices will rise, making it more expensive to buy a home.</li>
<li>Potential in the move-up market, as homeowners take advantage of the price increases.</li>
<li>Sales volumes will continue to increase with more conventional sales.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What Does This Mean for Agents?</h2>
<p>There are many signs that the real estate market is returning and recovering. With increasing opportunities, 2014 is looking like a great year for agents. In 2013, we have seen recovery and the start of a seller’s market; 2014 will continue to be good for sellers as prices rise. For agents focusing on listings, developing leads and finding home sellers will be key to building business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ever wonder how Google makes so much money when it doesn’t seem to charge it’s users for anything? The answer is Google Adwords. Advertising made Google over $43 billion in 2012.</p>
<p>That is over $100 million in search advertising and <a href="https://www.searchenginewatch.com/2012/10/26/how-google-rakes-in-over-100-million-in-search-advertising-daily-infographic/">237.9 million Google ad clicks</a> each day. Google does it by getting the vast majority of the Internet eyeballs.</p>
<h2>Why Agents Should Care About Adwords</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>90 percent of <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics/research-reports/real-estate-in-a-digital-age">homebuyers searched online</a> during their home-buying process.</li>
<li>Real estate-related searches on Google grew 253 percent over the past four years.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Search Ads</h2>
<p>These are the ads in Google search results on the top and to the right of the “organic” unpaid results. Search has become the go-to place for homebuyers and sellers, and one of the best ways to find and connect with active home searchers is on Google. You can go the organic route and optimize your website, which may or may not be enough to improve your rank in search results, or you can pay to be up with the big players in the paid search ads.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-19741 " title="Google Adwords Search Results" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Google-Adwords-Search-Results.png" alt="Google Adwords enables real estate agents to advertise online in paid search results" width="683" height="420" /></p>
<h2>How Does it Work?</h2>
<p>You choose the phrases, called keywords, that will cause your ad to appear in the paid search results. Google determines which ads appear based on an auction as well as the quality and relevance of your site and ad copy to the keyword.</p>
<p>For example, an agent in Bellevue, Wash. wants to connect with homebuyers in that area. If the agent sets up a campaign and bids on “Bellevue WA homes for sale,” his ad may or may not show up. Google decides which ads to display and where they are displayed.</p>
<h2>Why Might Ads Not Appear?</h2>
<p>Ad Rank is determined based on the max CPC (cost per click) bid price you set and a complicated and secret algorithm known as Quality Score. How quality score is determined is a super-secret of Google’s, but it is Google’s assessment of how relevant your chosen keyword is to your site, your ad copy and the Adwords history. If the combined score is lower than your competitors&#8217;, your ad will show up below theirs or not at all.</p>
<p>Another reason an ad might not show up is if the ad is disapproved or budget is near or at the limit. If your budget is lower than Google thinks it can spend in a day, they will show your ad less frequently. Google now also personalizes their search to the individual user. This mean each time someone searches, the results may be different, even if the advertisers don’t change anything.</p>
<p>So, if the agent’s ad in the example above is showing up when someone searches for “Bellevue homes for sale,” he probably meets these requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-19871" title="Google Adwords Example" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Google-Adwords-Example.png" alt="Ads must meet certain requirements in order to be effective in Google Adwords" width="234" height="97" />Ad copy includes an offer to view Bellevue homes for sale.</li>
<li>Landing page takes the user to listings for Bellevue homes.</li>
<li>Campaign has enough budget remaining.</li>
<li>Bid max CPC is high compared to competition (above the first page bid estimate).</li>
<li>Ad meets Google editorial guidelines; no disapprovals.</li>
</ul>
<p>Search ads are just the beginning of what Google offers. Let’s look at the different types of ads you can use with Google Adwords to attract homebuyers and sellers.</p>
<h2>Mobile Ads</h2>
<p>These are text or banner ads on mobile devices. These are automatically targeted in your search campaigns. Home buying is going mobile, and according to a National Association of Realtors® study, 89 percent of new home shoppers use a mobile search engine in their research.</p>
<p>Best practice for mobile: Mobile can and often does perform differently than computer traffic. You will need to monitor the performance and set different bid adjustments for your ads.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-19771 " title="Mobile Adwords" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/adwords-home7.png" alt="Mobile advertising can help real estate agents reach more leads" width="391" height="266" /></p>
<h2>Display Text Ads &amp; Banner Ads</h2>
<p>Not only can you target people searching for content, you can also target people looking at content. There are Google ad placements all over the Internet, from local blogs to top news and content sites. All these sites together are known collectively as the Google Display Network. These campaigns are different than search campaigns since the audience is not actively searching, but browsing pages. This leads to generally lower click-through rates (the percentage of people who click on your ad).</p>
<p>This is a good way for agents to get even more traffic and connect with more homebuyers, but is more complicated to optimize since you have to convey the type of content on which your ad should appear and exclude placements that are not working.</p>
<p>Best practice: Turn off display on your search campaigns to start out with. In Adwords, the default for new campaigns is to have both the search network and display network turned on, despite Google saying it is a best practice to have separate campaigns for search and display. If you are interested in building out display campaigns, then build a second campaign for display. This will allow you to better set up the display campaign for success, better monitor the performance of your display campaign, and make sure your search campaigns that are hopefully performing great keep performing great.</p>
<h2>Video Ads – YouTube or Display Network</h2>
<p>You can also use Google Adwords to promote a video. One option is to run video ads like banner ads. These ads are outside YouTube and will appear on the display network sites as banner ads, but with video content instead of a banner image.  Another option is to use In-Stream ads. These are commercial videos that run automatically before the video that a viewer has selected. The viewer can skip the commercial after 15 seconds. This would be best for short video ads. A third option is to use in-search or in-display ad. These are the text and image ads that appear in YouTube search results and next to videos. Use these for more informational videos about neighborhoods or real estate how-tos, not commercials. Video advertising has great potential for agents, since <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics/research-reports/real-estate-in-a-digital-age">51 percent of home shoppers</a> report using YouTube in their home search.</p>
<p>Best Practice: Make videos 30 seconds or less; many people have short attention spans and may want to watch multiple videos.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-19811 " title="Video Advertising" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Video-Advertising.png" alt="Many homebuyers use videos during their online home search" width="479" height="371" /></p>
<p>Google Adwords is a great way to generate leads and connect to homebuyer and sellers. There are many different options and things to learn in order for agents to advertise effectively. Market Leader has a team of Google Adwords experts that run advertising for all our paid leads products.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-18681" title="Does Your Website Capture Leads or Let Them Get Away?" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Fotolia_52250682_XS-300x225.jpg" alt="Just getting visitors to your real estate website is not enough to capture leads" width="300" height="225" />Don’t let this happen to you. An agent decides to get involved with online lead generation. He creates online advertisements with Facebook, Craigslist, and Google Adwords in an attempt to direct traffic to his site. However, after spending much time and money on these ads, the agent has no leads to show for it and blames these sources for providing low-quality traffic. In reality, this agent’s lead generation woes are just as likely to be from having a website that is poorly designed for capturing leads as they are from poorly performing ad campaigns.</p>
<p>Getting visitors to your site is only half the battle of online advertising. If your website does not convert even the highest quality visitors to leads, your online lead generation efforts are doomed to failure. Your website needs to both engage your visitors with the information they are looking for and ask for their contact information so you can reach out and turn them into clients.</p>
<h2>Give the Visitors What They Want</h2>
<p>Your website needs engaging content if you want visitors to stay and not bounce back to search engine results – or other real estate sites! Let us clue you in on what types of content consumers are apt to get engaged with. Homebuyers conducting their home search online want to look at listings, specifically listing photos. Home sellers want to find out what their home is worth and look at listings to find a new home.</p>
<p>If your website does not have listings &#8211; or listing photos &#8211; you are not giving online home searchers the content they’re looking for. They do not want to spend time on your website’s home page, “About me” page, or “Contact me” page. It may be a blow to some agents’ egos, but homebuyers’ number one priority is to look at listings and listing photos – not learn about you! Give consumers what they want, and make sure your online lead generation efforts link to those pages. Direct them to any other page and you run the risk of your would-be leads bouncing back to search engine results or to other agents’ sites.</p>
<h2>Ask for Their Contact Information</h2>
<p>For agents who get all of their business from referrals, and whose websites are only visited by consumers they’ve already spoken with, asking visitors to “register” on their site is completely unnecessary. Very few agents fall into this category, however. If you are one of the many agents who spends much time and money driving consumers to your site, capturing visitors’ contact information is incredibly important. Consumers who visit your site are actively looking at buying or selling a home and are likely to transact with someone; if you don’t at least ask for their contact information, you will greatly diminish your ability to get in touch with them, thus making it less likely they will transact with you! Here are some important stats for you to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Market Leader generates hundreds of thousands of leads per month by using many online lead generation methods.</li>
<li>We have myriad pages specifically optimized to get conversions – i.e., capture leads’ contact information when they arrive on these landing pages.</li>
<li>Our campaigns achieve around a 10 to 12 percent conversion rate, on average, for Internet search traffic by prompting visitors to register by entering their contact information.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your site has a contact form that is user initiated only (i.e., one that does not have an interruptive prompting to fill out the contact form), count on achieving conversion rates of 1 percent or less, depending on how the contact form is set up and where it is located on the page. The adage, “If you don’t ask, you won’t get” applies to lead generation. Asking your website’s visitors to register will get you 10 times more potential business than waiting for them to volunteer their contact information on their own volition.</p>
<p>If you still don’t think it is worthwhile to ask for your visitors’ contact information, know that 24 percent of new <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/Study-Digital-House-Hunt-2013-01_1.pdf">online home shoppers</a> complete an action on a real estate site the same day they start researching and 78 percent visit multiple real estate sites.</p>
<p>The important conclusion you should come to from these statistics: If you don’t get contact information from first-time visitors and follow up with them immediately, some other agent will get the deal!</p>
<h2>Encourage Revisits</h2>
<p>Depending on their timelines, it can take anywhere between one month and two years before online searchers transact. A study by Hebert Research found that aspiring homebuyers can take two whole years to actually buy a home after they first consider doing so and, just as important, only spend a relatively small amount of time actively searching for homes.</p>
<p>How does this fact apply to your website’s structure? After you get contact information from home searchers, following up with them is a must. Encourage visitors to come back to your site with listing alerts that meet their home search criteria &#8211; since, as we discussed above, homebuyers are most interested in seeing home listings. Following up with your leads and re-engaging them in your website will help ensure that you stay top of mind throughout the early stages of their homebuying process.</p>
<p>Integrating your website with your CRM makes generating repeat visits a lot easier. The Market Leader system has agents’ IDX-enabled websites send automated listings alerts, drip email campaigns, newsletters and more.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/does-your-website-capture-leads-or-let-them-get-away/">Does Your Website Capture Leads or Let Them Get Away?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to recent data from the National Association of Realtors®, 90 percent of homebuyers start their search online. It is thus vital for agents to have an online presence if they want to catch homebuyers when they first start searching! Online advertising is a great way to capture consumers early during the home-buying or selling process. When you think about online searching, you may just think of searches conducted through Google, the world’s preeminent search engine, which has a <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-dwarfs-bing-yahoo-as-traffic-source-for-major-news-sites-170660">65 to 70 percent market share</a> of searches in the U.S. Don’t forget Bing, though! While Bing only receives about 30 percent of search engine traffic, it still receives <a href="https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Press-Releases/2013/2/comScore-Releases-January-2013-US-Search-Engine-Rankings">over 5 billion searches a month</a>.</p>
<h2>What are Bing Ads?</h2>
<p>Bing Ads are text advertisements that appear in Bing and Yahoo! search results. Bing Ads are virtually identical to Google AdWords, the text ads in Google’s search engine result pages, except they are run by Microsoft. These ads show up on the top and right-hand side of search engine results pages, and the top two to three ads often appear a second time below the search results. Here&#8217;s an example from Microsoft showing where the ads are displayed:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en-us/h/a/microsoft-advertising?tab=how&amp;s_cid=us_smb_a_product_how"><img loading="lazy" class=" aligncenter" title="Bing Ads" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Bing-Ads1.png" alt="Bing Ads Example" width="493" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>You pick the search terms you want for your ads. These are known as keywords, and can include terms like “real estate” in the example below. You can also choose to have searchers from specific regions see the ad when they use your selected keywords, a strategy known as IP targeting.</p>
<p>Where your ad shows up in search engine results is determined by your bid price (the max price you are willing to pay every time your ad is clicked), quality score (relevance of your landing page and ad to the keyword you select) and how fierce the competition is with other advertisers. The bid price you enter is not necessarily the price you will actually pay per click; instead, it is the maximum amount of money that you will be charged for the click.</p>
<p>All of this should sound familiar if you have worked with Google AdWords in the past. If you are running Google AdWords campaigns for real estate, the process will easily translate to Bing.</p>
<h2>Easy to Set Up for Existing Google Campaigns</h2>
<p>If you already have Google AdWords campaigns, Microsoft has made it easy to import them into Bing Ads. Simply click the “Campaign” button in the header, and log in to your Google Account through Bing to import all your keywords, ad text and settings directly from Google.</p>
<p><strong>Two pieces of advice on Google AdWords vs. Bing Ads</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While it is easy to import ads from Google AdWords, be advised that what works on Google may not work on Bing.</li>
<li> Google AdWords and Bing Ads both require testing and optimization to make them work well.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Here are some best practices for importing Google AdWords into Bing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use the Bing and Yahoo networks only.</li>
<li>Check and adjust your negative keywords (search terms that you don’t want your ad to show up on) and IP targeting (searchers’ locations you want your ad to show up on).</li>
<li>Use/update tracking codes so you can compare the performance of your Bing and Google ads in your website analytics.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bing Searchers are More Likely to Be Homebuyers</h2>
<p>Home searchers who are actively looking for listings and agents visit both Google and Bing. However, <a href="https://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/search-engine-optimization/comparing-google-and-bing-demographics/">Bing users</a> may be more likely to be homebuyers, since they are older and more likely to have children.</p>
<h2>Bing&#8217;s Cost-Per-Click (CPC) Is Less Than Google’s</h2>
<p>Since Bing is still ignored by many advertisers, it is a less competitive advertising marketplace. This means that Bing has a lower CPC. Hubspot, a marketing software company, recently compared its clients’ CPC on Bing and Google and found that Bing saved them 49 to 71 percent per click.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Hubspot.png" alt="Hubspot Lower CPC on Bing" /></p>
<p>A case study by Bing found that a travel company achieves 50 percent lower average CPC with Bing Ads.</p>
<p>These are great stats, but how do they apply to real estate? Let us share how we use Bing Ads. Market Leader has incorporated Bing Ads into our advertising mix, and we build out campaigns for each and every Leads Direct customer. Using both Bing Ads and Google AdWords has allowed us to deliver more leads to customers – at a lower overall cost per lead – than we are able to achieve using just Google.</p>
<p>Market Leader has also experienced lower Bing CPCs when managing ads for its customers. Bing CPCs vary greatly by location, but Market Leader’s real estate ad campaigns have found that the cost-per-click savings on Bing are greatest in high positions. This doesn’t mean that Bing is always the better deal. The amount of traffic Bing can deliver is lower, so an ad with a low position on Google can sometimes get the same amount of traffic as a highly positioned Bing ad – for the same price. Using both Bing and Google is the way to get the most traffic at the lowest price.</p>
<h2>Should You Start and Manage Your Own Bing Campaigns?</h2>
<p>If you are looking to do search engine marketing (SEM) yourself, Bing would be a valuable addition to your search marketing campaigns. Both Google and Bing require a lot of work and expertise to get the most out of them. Taking the time to learn and optimize Google AdWords and Bing Ads will take time away from your core business activity – selling real estate.</p>
<p>It may make the most sense for you to hire someone to create and manage your search marking campaigns for you. There are many agencies and consultants that do this type of work, but their services are expensive. They may not be willing to work with you if your budget is small. If you are interested in SEM, but have limited budget and time, Market Leader’s Leads Direct product might be the answer.</p>
<p>With Leads Direct, Market Leader builds out and optimizes Google AdWords and Bing Ads campaigns for you. Instead of paying search engines for clicks, Leads Direct allows you to get homebuyers and sellers – leads – to register directly on your site. Market Leader makes life easier for its customers by setting up and managing their search engine advertising campaigns and delivering quality leads directly to them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-18111" title="SEO Tips for Real Estate Agents" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Fotolia_44888847_XS-300x208.jpg" alt="Real estate agents can use SEO to improve online marketing " width="300" height="208" /></a>Organic – it’s not just what’s for dinner. Like organic food, however, organic traffic to your website is obtained naturally – without paying for it or having it referred from a directory or another site.</p>
<p>In fact, organic traffic is sent to your site because the search engines “think” your site is interesting or relevant to the search terms. They like you &#8211; they really like you.</p>
<p>Since not every real estate agent can make it to the front page of Google, the question of the millennium is: “Why not?”</p>
<h2>Why Doesn’t My Site Show Up in Google?</h2>
<p>Google uses a long list of criteria – over 200 factors – to determine which pages rank for which search terms. The whole process is bundled in what is known as an algorithm, defined by Google as “&#8230; computer programs that look for clues to give you back exactly what you want.”</p>
<p>When a user enters a search term, the algorithm clicks and whirs and tries to guess what the user wants to see. It does this by considering terms on the site, how fresh the content is, what region the searcher is in, and &#8220;page rank.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, although just owning a website and publishing it to the Web doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll automatically rank, it is the first step.</p>
<h2>Organic Traffic Isn’t “Free”</h2>
<p>Earlier we defined organic traffic as being that which you don’t have to pay for. Although that makes it sound as if it’s free, don’t be fooled.</p>
<p>It takes time and effort to optimize your website for search engines – to have the content and links that Bing and Google find rank-worthy.  Because your time is better spent drumming up clients, chasing after organic Web traffic can actually be quite expensive.</p>
<p>Then, consider that there are no guarantees that all that work will pay off and put you above all the other agents in town when someone is searching for an agent.</p>
<h2>Tips to Improve Your Ranking</h2>
<p>Let’s take a look at some ways to nudge you ahead in Bing’s and Google’s rankings.</p>
<h3>Compelling Content</h3>
<p>Market Leader’s senior trainer, Shannon Shimabukuro, suggests beefing up your content. If you’re just starting a website, ensure that the content you use is “relevant, fresh and unique” so that it provides value for the user and positions you as the hyper-local expert.</p>
<p>Don’t just promote your latest listings, but tell readers what’s so great about living in your area. Let them know about interesting restaurants, the best dog parks in the area, where to get the best cup of coffee or hamburger. Sprinkle in advice on homebuying and selling.</p>
<p>This isn’t a one-time task. Content has to remain fresh, which means you’ll need to spend time (or pay someone else) to make consistent updates to your content library.</p>
<h3>Use Target-Audience Keywords</h3>
<p>Think of keywords as a breadcrumb trail that will lead potential clients to your website.</p>
<p>The keywords can be anything that your potential clients will enter into the search box when looking for an agent or a home. These keywords need to not only show up in your content, but in your page titles and images as well.</p>
<p>Shimabukuro cautions against “trying to rank for popular real estate search queries,” and recommends using hyper-local terms instead. For example, you’ll get a lot more hits using “condos in Hayes Valley” than you will for “San Francisco real estate.”</p>
<p>Finally, Shimabukuro cautions against the overuse of keywords; you don’t want to risk being considered a spammer by the search engines. She recommends using three to five phrases per page.</p>
<h3>Links</h3>
<p>The Miss Congenialities of Google have lots of links. Google’s algorithm takes a good look at the number and veracity of the sites that link to yours. Shimabukuro likens them to votes – the more links, the more popular the site. Link to your site from your blog and your social networking pages, and be sure to use your keywords when you create the links.</p>
<h2>Nothing in Life or on the Internet is Guaranteed</h2>
<p>The folks at <a href="https://moz.com/google-algorithm-change">Moz.com</a> claim that “Google changes its search algorithm around 500 to 600 times every year.” Not all of these changes have the impact of a Panda or Penguin update, but all you need is one big one to kick you back to where you started, leaving all your hard work in the dust.</p>
<p>While organic traffic is important, it’s just one aspect of a multipronged approach to Internet marketing.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/organic-traffic-isnt-free-beginner-seo-tips-for-agents/">Organic Traffic Isn’t Free: Beginner SEO Tips for Agents</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>
