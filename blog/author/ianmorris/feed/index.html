<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #3366ff;"><a href="http://www.marketleader.com"><span style="color: #3366ff;">Market Leader</span></a></span>, as anyone reading this post on our blog would probably know, is the leading provider of Internet based customer relationship management &amp; marketing software in the residential real estate industry. <span style="color: #3366ff;"><a href="http://www.trulia.com"><span style="color: #3366ff;">Trulia</span></a></span> is a leading online destination for real estate, enabling real estate professionals to communicate with hundreds of thousands of transaction-ready home buyers and sellers each month. The combined company will have more than 135,000 software customers using Market Leader software AND more than 31 million home buyers and sellers that visit Trulia each month.</p>

<h2>Answers to Questions You Might Have</h2>
<p><strong>Q: What are you announcing?</strong></p>
<p>A: Trulia is acquiring Market Leader, and we believe the combined two companies will be the clear online real estate industry leader. The combination of Trulia and Market Leader will provide Market Leader’s 135,000 software customers with an incredible opportunity to gain access to the millions of transaction-ready consumers that visit Trulia each month, while providing Trulia customers with the sales and marketing platform they need to close more business.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How is this going to help my business?</strong></p>
<p>A: The merger of Market Leader and Trulia combines massive consumer demand with the only comprehensive software solution in the industry. Market Leader customers will continue to receive all the benefits from Market Leader existing products and services, and, over time, will benefit from new opportunities arising from integration of the two companies’ products.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What will happen to the Market Leader products I own?</strong></p>
<p>A: We will continue to support and invest in our current products. In fact, we believe that this combination will enable us to deliver even more enhancements, and more value to all of our customers on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will the price I’m currently paying change?</strong></p>
<p>A: No. This deal does not change your pricing.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will there be big changes at Market Leader?</strong></p>
<p>A: There will not be big changes at Market Leader. Market Leader will continue to operate under the Market Leader brand, be led by our CEO Ian Morris (that&#8217;s me) and the current management team, and largely continue all day-to-day operations unchanged. We are all very excited about this combination and what it will do for our customers and our employees.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Who can I call for customer support and questions?</strong></p>
<p>A: You can continue calling the same people, and using the same communication channels, you have been to date. Nothing changes on that front.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How will the companies be integrated?</strong></p>
<p>A: For the foreseeable future, we’ll continue to operate separately. It will be business as usual.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will Market Leader continue to invest in and enhance its products?</strong></p>
<p>A: Absolutely. We have a very active pipeline of new features and enhancements, and this combination will increase the pace at which we will continue to deliver them to you.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will this make it easier for me to add my Trulia leads to Market Leader Professional or Business Suite?</strong></p>
<p>A: Stay tuned. We’ll have something special to announce on that very soon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As many real estate markets stabilize, more and more brokers are saying that their #1 priority is growing their team. It’s likely you will discover <strong>the recruiting world is now very different from</strong>, say 2006. There are different expectations—agents are looking for a safety net, and the comfort and knowledge that you are going to be there helping to <strong>grow <em>their</em> business while they are growing <em>yours</em></strong>.<img loading="lazy" class="alignright" style="margin-left: 10px;margin-right: 10px" src="https://truereligiondebate.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/wwd_world2.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="259" /></p>
<p>1.  <strong>Think Ahead.</strong> An essential step to a successful recruiting strategy is understanding how many agents you need. It takes time to find good agents, so don’t forget to <strong><em>plan</em></strong>.</p>
<p>2.  <strong>Get Their Back. </strong>Top agents know what they are good at—and they know that they are more efficient and successful when they delegate the rest of the details to other team members. Before you even begin recruiting top agents, make sure you have ample support to <strong><em>help</em></strong> all your agents with day-to-day tasks.</p>
<p>3.  <strong>Show Them What You Do.</strong> When speaking with a recruit, show—don’t just tell— them how you are actively creating marketing materials and generating leads for your team. <strong><em>Prove</em> </strong>that you are committed to helping them grow and succeed in their business.</p>
<p>4.  <strong>Provide Systems for Success.</strong> Top agents know that there are dozens of agents in the area capable of closing a deal, but <strong>real</strong> success and high volume require a systematic approach to the business. If a broker is bringing in clients and actively working on business development, top agents will follow. This includes offering tools that cultivate prospects into clients <strong><em>fast!</em></strong> Any agent would prefer to work a hot or warm lead than spend time cold-calling. <strong><em>Call extra attention</em></strong> to all of the tools you offer when you’re recruiting—it’s <em>that</em> important.</p>
<p>And above all, <strong><em>sell them</em></strong> on your company. If they are good, it’s worth your while to put effort into building a relationship with them. They are likely to be significantly more valuable to you than any high-value client.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/a-whole-new-worldrecruiting-and-retaining-agents-in-2010/">A Whole New World…Recruiting and Retaining Agents in 2010</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I spent a few days in Dallas this week for the 2010 Gathering of Eagles, a conference for the nation&#8217;s largest real estate brokerage companies put on by Real Trends each year.  While our industry has more conferences that most of us can attend, I always find the Gathering to be an excellent event and a good way to get a pulse for the state of the real estate industry.  Some quick takeaways:</p>
<p>· State of the Market &#8211; the tone of this year&#8217;s event was decidedly more positive than last year&#8217;s.  While I don&#8217;t think many leaders are expecting a robust market any time soon, most feel that the worst is behind us.  Brokerage companies see the current environment as an opportunity differentiate themselves and seem more willing to invest (albeit cautiously) to take market share.</p>
<p>· Network Level Innovation &#8211; There was an interesting panel featuring the leaders of the leading real estate franchisors and networks.  I heard good commentary from all of the participants but was particularly engaged by Pam O&#8217;Connor, CEO of The Leading Real Estate Companies of the World, and Mark Willis, CEO of Keller Williams.  Both leaders clearly articulated the ways in which they differentiate what they do from other franchise organizations.   It&#8217;s easy to see why both companies have continued to be successful in even the most challenging of environments.</p>
<p>· Lead Generation &#8211; More and more attention continues to be paid to lead generation, and all aspects of the who, what, where, and how to be successful at it.  In the &#8220;boom&#8221;, many companies seemed to take a ‘who needs it&#8217; approach to the space, but now it&#8217;s clear that the brokers and the networks know they need to create compelling lead generation strategies if they are going to effectively compete for consumers and for agents.</p>
<p>There were many other excellent talks as well.  Steve Murray, CEO of Real Trends and host of the event, as always, provided valuable insights about where Real Trends sees the market heading over the next few years.  This insight is a big part of why so many leaders make their way to the event every year.  Rich Barton, CEO of Zillow, did a great job of engaging the audience with his take on what&#8217;s to come, and the important role that the iPad and technologies like it will play in the future.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="&quot;float: right; padding: 0px 0px 0px 3px;&quot; " style="float: right;padding: 0px 0px 0px 3px" src="https://activerain-store.s3.amazonaws.com/image_store/uploads/9/1/7/7/8/ar12735172587719.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="240" />And speaking of Rich, it sounds like he and I both hit a few tennis balls with the same pro at the hotel.  I didn&#8217;t know Rich was a tennis player until the pro mentioned that another guy from Seattle had just been out on the court, and that the two of us should play when we get back to the Seattle area.  When I asked how I would do against Rich, he just kept saying &#8220;too close to call, but it would be a great battle&#8221;.  So what do you say Rich &#8211; Can I interest you in an online real estate tennis match?  Perhaps we could even make it interesting &#8211; for charity, of course.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/what-real-estate-brokers-are-thinking-about-this-spring-gathering-of-eagles-recap/">What Real Estate Brokers Are Thinking About This Spring (Gathering of Eagles Recap)</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>
