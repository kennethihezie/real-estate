					<description><![CDATA[Hi there,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My article wasn&#039;t directed at your company, but at all those who provide useless information to agents and call that information &quot;leads.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fact is that we have cheapened the meaning of so many things in this society today that no one should be surprised that &quot;leads&quot; are included. To me, a lead is a customer-initiated contact where the contact enters their name, phone and/or email, and hopefully a relevant comment about what they are truly seeking. There&#039;s one more factor: the contact must have come from the client&#039;s site, not from an amalgamation site.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a real prospect asks an agent a specific question about something seen on that agent&#039;s site, we call that the opening of a dialogue, and a real lead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everyone needs real leads.]]></description>

<p>My article wasn&#39;t directed at your company, but at all those who provide useless information to agents and call that information &#8220;leads.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fact is that we have cheapened the meaning of so many things in this society today that no one should be surprised that &#8220;leads&#8221; are included. To me, a lead is a customer-initiated contact where the contact enters their name, phone and/or email, and hopefully a relevant comment about what they are truly seeking. There&#39;s one more factor: the contact must have come from the client&#39;s site, not from an amalgamation site.</p>
<p>When a real prospect asks an agent a specific question about something seen on that agent&#39;s site, we call that the opening of a dialogue, and a real lead.</p>
<p>Everyone needs real leads.</p>
