					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketleader.com/blog/real-estate-volunteer-opportunities/#comment-68389&quot;&gt;Suzanne&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi Suzanne, 
Appreciate your feedback. Remember, though, that this article isn&#039;t about social change, it&#039;s about how community involvement can help both the non profit AND the agent&#039;s business. I actually state clearly that neither is of greater value &quot;While neither of these types of giving back to the community is necessarily “better’ in the main, the latter is hands down better for your real estate business.&quot; Market Leader is in the business of helping agents build their practices and this is one way that works AND helps contribute to the greater good of any community. Again, I do appreciate the feedback!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sometimes, though, what nonprofits need most is cash to cover operating costs, direct program expenses, and all the other aspects of making social change happen. Your article seemed to imply boots-on-the-ground and hands-on giving somehow were of greater value to communities. Not so. Both are needed. Did you know, most nonprofits, large and small, have trouble covering basic expenses for salary and overhead; and few have more than a month or two of reserves stashed for a rainy day, loss of a major gift, or lower than anticipated campaign results.]]></description>
