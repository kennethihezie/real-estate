Thanks for reaching out, Marty. What conflicting information are you getting? Just a heads up, this article was originally written in 2013 so, while a lot of the information is evergreen, some areas covered might have changed a bit. If you let us know which information you&#039;re looking for, we can do our best to clarify.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It was really interesting to learn the difference between the organic results and the AdWords results, I didn&#039;t even realize that. I didn&#039;t know that to get to the top of Google, all I had to do was buy some ad space! That&#039;s amazing, thanks for sharing these tips - these are going to be very useful once I find an agency to help out with this :)
