					<description><![CDATA[Thanks Shannon, wonderful question and definitely something that is worth digging into deeper. One our clients sent me this link and said, here you go, the internet says Instagram&#039;s a waste of time for us (they&#039;re in real-estate), so we&#039;re not sure we should dive in.

I couldn&#039;t disagree more.

Pinterest daily active #&#039;s are nosediving and it&#039;s not suited to content creation on the go (just an aggregator), especially in a mobile world.

Skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it&#039;s been.

(Full disclosure: we&#039;re an Instagram plaftorm customization partner in Canada and &quot;all-in&quot; so to speak, so clearly a little biased here.)]]></description>
