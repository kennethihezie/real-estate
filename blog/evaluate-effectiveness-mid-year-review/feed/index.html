					<description><![CDATA[I am using Market Leader since Feb 2011 and received 55 leads and Pay $ 329.00 a month. None of the leads are good, not even one. Their leads either give you wrong contact information or just don’t give you any contact at all. When I called the customer service they say I HAVE to pay till my contract is over and I should have faith in their system and should subscribe for at least a year , that means should pay them $3948.00 before I get one good lead ?]]></description>
