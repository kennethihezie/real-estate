Hi Denise - so sorry you&#039;re experiencing issues with that HOA! Because laws and rights vary from state to state, we recommend seeking advice from a a professional in your area. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.avvo.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;avvo.com&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent (and free) legal resource where you can ask accredited council in your area for advice. Hope you find the answers and help you&#039;re looking for!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey, My name is Denise and I have been trying to buy a modular home in Nokomis Fla. in a 55+ community now for 7 months. I was denied the first time because of a low credit score which there is no criteria in their regulations and rules. I was asked to pay off all my debt, to show 6 months of rent which I did, and pay another 250.00 which I did and my credit score is on the rise. 100 pts so far so I reapplied and they still are denying me. I have done everything they ask me too. I am paying cash and my rent here is 2000.00 a month and the HOA is 233.00 so there is no way they could keep denying me because of my credit. I`m beginning to think it is something else. Can I sue them for discrimination? I am not paying rent to the HOA.   Thank you :)]]></description>
