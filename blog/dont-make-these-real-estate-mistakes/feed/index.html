					<description><![CDATA[The key to becoming a Top producing agent in any Market is “Direct Mail” and a consistent email marketing! Start with  family and friends and people you know. 
This is why 65 percent of Real Estate Agents fail after 2 years!  In my 12 years in real estate! Most Millennials do not believe in direct mail and it’s like pulling teeth to get them to create a email  data base, and mailing addresses in neighborhoods they want to sell in!  Real Estate is a  Business based off of referrals. The larger data base you have the more homes you will sell and this is a fact!
 Remember one thing, 
“Out of sight out of mind”
Agents need to send hand written post cards to past cliants ,Happy Thinksgiving Emails &#038; postcards happy holidays, Happy New Years to everyone you know.  Another hand written card or a post card congratulating your buyer or sellers after a closing! That’s the best gift you can give a Cliant!  
After that send a  6 month anniversary mailer asking them how they are enjoying there new home ex ex!
“Then the 1 year anniversary of there sale” this should also be a hand written post card and this goes a long way! Now is when you can start asking them for Business.  “You are now in the friend zone :) not just a Realtor! Pamper your clients and they will stick with you!
If you do this with persistence and consistency you will  be a success!
