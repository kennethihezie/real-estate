Not necessarily true.  Most investors I&#039;ve interacted with prefer to have a herd of Realtors working different angles (and cross-over) of the market.  The relationship style has to fit both parties, ultimately.  I&#039;m grateful for the great investor clients I do work with and always bring them opportunities that I find first before opening to my other buyer lists.  I do work with some new investors but don&#039;t bring them deals till they are ready to pull the trigger.  Good article.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like that you pointed out that real estate agents should already know the basics about dealing with investors.  As you said, investors want to move quickly and don&#039;t want to deal with someone who doesn&#039;t know what they&#039;re doing.  While training probably can&#039;t prepare a real estate agent for everything, it should be able to be enough to give them the basis to spring off of and be successful when talking to investors.  Thanks for the article.]]></description>
