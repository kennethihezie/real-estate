					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for sharing a brief glimpse into your life as an agent.  I recently had a birthday and turned 30. Before, I had no idea as to what I wanted to do with my life when it came to a career. I have four sons, and didn&#039;t want to be stuck on an assembly line and I dont have the stomach for the medical field. Your highlight passage has helped me to stay motivated on becoming a successful real estate agent.
