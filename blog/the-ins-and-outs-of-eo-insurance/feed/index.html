					<description><![CDATA[What&#039;s a big question is, if the broker is the liable party (with a contracted associate) these matters are usually between broker vs. broker or the listing broker and the selling broker. In CA, the agents must work under the brokers license so, when it comes to insurance, isn&#039;t the E&#038;O insurance going to name the Broker only, not the agent? So then, who pays the deductible, the named insured (the broker) or the agent?  

Lots of brokers charge a portion of their insurance premiums to the agent via a flat fee per escrow so the question then is, does that establish a policy for that escrow or is that fee simply a share of the entire annual premium? 

So, if the named insured is the broker and the premiums are paid by the broker, who legally pays the deductible if there is a claim? Since the agent cannot conduct real estate transactions on their own, it appears the insurance is going to be showing the broker as the insured and the broker will pay an annual premium while simply asking for contributions of the premiums divided by the agents. If so, whey would a broker suggest the agent pay the huge deductible when a claim is filed?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketleader.com/blog/the-ins-and-outs-of-eo-insurance/#comment-139469&quot;&gt;Roger Remer&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi Roger - Thank you for reaching out! Our best advice is to look into the specific contract you have with your broker to see what&#039;s covered. In addition to each brokerage being different, litigations and insurance vary from state to state. In this case, your broker is your best resource for getting this question answered. 

We hope that helps!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Jason,
What an informative post. Thank you so much for taking the time to write this and to explain in depth the many positives of E&#038;O Insurance. What many people do not realize is the amount of people that are fully protected from start to finish.
Thanks again,
Taylor]]></description>
