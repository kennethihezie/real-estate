					<description><![CDATA[Frugal is the new chic!
What about the about town uptown girl and her mini?    The savvy and frugal zipping between the cars and parking at the front door of condos with their scooters?
Are there any big V8 realtors still out there?    Brelcreme and Leisure Suits OH My!

storyteller marketing and videos let people look at you first and decide....

Give them what they see on the video&#039;s, integrity, enthusiasm and content.
