					<description><![CDATA[I have a question what do you do when a real estate company steals leads from your private page using a CONTACT ME button under your image?  They have also created pages with my Image/Brand yet used another agents name and group.  I just think there must be some rule about stealing leads I generated one of which was me myself filling out paperwork on my own web site then getting a call from a agent who was given it by the IT guy at the company.  Any response to this would be appreciate.]]></description>
