					<description><![CDATA[2017 was a notable year in India owing to the number of financial reforms introduced by the government. While 2017 will go down in history for all the right reasons, 2018 will be a model year in its own right. 2018 is expected to see a huge spike in the real estate industry and the effects of it on real estate are already visible.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketleader.com/blog/2018-real-estate-trends-boomerang-buyers/#comment-114241&quot;&gt;Iris Black&lt;/a&gt;.

I too am a GEN Xer who was affected by the Great Recession, along with my husband, having to short sale our home back in 2011.  My husband lost his job (I was staying home with our two very small children)  and we depleted our savings over a 2 year period of time while my husband worked tirelessly at a job that paid a 1/4 of what he was being paid before, while I waited tables at night (so we didn&#039;t have to pay for daycare).  
I am in agreement with the what Jennifer wrote above, I believe there won&#039;t be another bubble or house of cards like what we experienced in 08 due to different lending practices that are in place now.  I think the rapid increase in home prices will flatten out this year or the following due to the fact that peoples incomes are not keeping up with the increase in home prices. 

I actually became a real estate agent 3 years ago, as I too, became obsessed with real estate after the trauma my family and I faced.  Thankfully my husband got a terrific job and we were able to put 20% down a buy a home 5 years ago.  
I am hopeful that the tax cuts to both families and businesses alike, combined; I pray, with &quot;REAL&quot; affordable health care sometime very soon, will spur on good paying full time jobs and put a little bit more money in peoples pockets that can be used towards down payments and/or closing costs and allow more home buyers to enter the market place or move to a home of their dreams.  If the extra money isn&#039;t used for a home then hopefully in the free market place where they use that money the way they wish to use it (since they earned it) and not forced given to the government for it to be wasted.  
Best wishes to you Jennifer!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So, all those who were hit on their faces with chapter 7 bankruptcies in the last recession, would probably re-enter the current market. A market which would soon be affected by the corporate tax cuts by the Republicans, just like the one in 2002, which had led to the debt-financing real estate crash later. The tax cuts are different this time, but the design is same, and it would likely show repercussions in all sectors very soon.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article for new real estate investors! In the upcoming year 2018, due to increase in home prices, it is very difficult for many home buyers to buy a house. Always be active with social media to get aware of the real estate latest market prices. Keep sharing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great Article.  As a Gen-Xer, I can relate to this article very well.  Forgotten?  Yes!  I never thought about it like that until reading this article, but yes, we are. Going through a foreclosure myself (with husband), which finalized 8/2009, we are JUST NOW eligible for traditional mortgage financing. Everyone we have talked to about trying to buy a house, said come back after the 7-yr post foreclosure mark, nothing they could do for us until then.  Meanwhile, we are watching from the sidelines with heavy hearts, as housing prices swing back up.  

Buying a townhouse in 10/2007 for $265K, then watching the market literally crash before our eyes just months later, losing a job, and eventually the townhouse, and watching it sell a year after that on the free market for a scant $70K, was an excruciatingly painful lesson I will never forget.  Trust?  Absolutely!  We were told when we bought, get in now before we are priced out. Prices had just begun to soften a bit, so &quot;now is the time to get in,&quot; and &quot;soft landing&quot; were the buzz words of the day.  

I have become obsessed with the real estate market since.  I do not believe we are in a bubble,in fact, I believe this market has plenty of room to grow in the current cycle.  But many other Gen Exers do believe this is another bubble, or at least, they are having fears that it is... or could be...  and so, have adopted the &quot;burn me once, shame on you, burn me twice, shame on me&quot; mentality.  The Gen Exers I talk to are planning to wait until &quot;after the next crash,&quot; and then swoop in and take back the opportunity that was lost to them in the Great Recession.  I&#039;m sorry to say, but I believe they will be heartbroken again when prices continue to rise, and if/when prices do top out in the current cycle, and pull back, it won&#039;t be the crash they are hoping for.  It will once again be time/opportunity lost.

Just my 2 cents.]]></description>
