					<description><![CDATA[Loving the videos, a lot of agents aren&#039;t taking full advantage of multimedia on the Internet and I can never figure out why. I&#039;m no computer whiz, but I hire people for that, and I think every agent should be doing their part to &quot;Get out there&quot; more, to get better photos and videos of their properties, and to do a better job of branding themselves.

I&#039;ve added this article to my favorites and if you don&#039;t mind, I&#039;m going to print out a couple copies to pass around at the office. Thanks so much for providing this content for free, you&#039;re doing a great service to agents all around the world.

					<description><![CDATA[Andy,

Great article, you got the biggies, but you are missing Pinterest. That site is read and used 80% of the time by women. And women are buying and making more decisions in the household. Don&#039;t neglect the power of the woman. Etsy and Houzz are also good sites to help post items for women to see you as a trusted resource. Social media is all about being social, so I would recommend you let the readers know, don&#039;t use Hootsuite as a crutch, engage with your users, past customers and be SOCIAL!
