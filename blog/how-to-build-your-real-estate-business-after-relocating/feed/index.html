Hello Rachel and Elaine!
I&#039;m a fairly new agent but had a great first year in the Philly suburbs area. I&#039;m also moving to Ohio. How are you ladies making out? I see it&#039;s a fast moving market like where I&#039;m at now. Would love to talk if you&#039;re interested! 484-888-8228, kelly.rebar@kw.com]]></description>

Rachel, just curious if you made the move to CO from Ohio and , if so, how did your business fare?  I am also considering making a move there and I also am a veteran agent now in Florida and previously in Massachusetts.  Any input would be great!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I stumbled upon this while planning to move my 20 year real estate career to Colorado from Ohio.    It has been my dream to live there for quite some time.  This is valuable and gives even a veteran agent the &quot;refresher&quot; that YES! You can do it! 

Thanks!]]></description>
