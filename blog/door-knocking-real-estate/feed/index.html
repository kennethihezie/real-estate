					<description><![CDATA[Just had an agent ask my kids if I was home (they were in the driveway and I was at my neighbors house trying to help her collect her things to go to the hospital after her husband was in a bad accident).  
This KW agent then approaches me in the street, calling me by my name, but not telling me who he is with (I had to ask).

Coming to my door/house shows me you do not respect my privacy.  Talking to my kids is a surefire way to make sure I won’t use you or your agency to sell my home.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just landed a listing appointment within fifteen minutes of door knocking. I&#039;d rather talk to people face to face. It&#039;s much easier to build rapport. It&#039;s all in your attitude if you expect to meet cold, rude people, that&#039;s exactly what&#039;ll happen. People pick up on your vibe pretty quickly. Stay positive and you&#039;ll make some really good connections.]]></description>

Wow! This is not the forum for this type of behavior. Maybe instead of showing total ignorance and bigotry toward other groups of people, why not show some intelligence by learning about others through an original source instead of believing everything you hear? Or is it fear that you’ll find out the truth?]]></description>

That video is completely BS. That team does not sell that many homes. The sudden who&#039;s speaking on the video I&#039;ve told repeatedly to stop calling me and stop door knocking and he repeatedly always goes well I have dyslexia which is a complete lie. This guy will sit there and scam you in any way possible to try to get your listing on top of it I just Googled them and it looks like their whole team of six just fell apart]]></description>

Good that you tell them upfront that you&#039;re not interested. Saves them time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello,Everybody. i just started door knocking in my community. Thru my first couple of days doing it I found two sellers. Unfortunately they are only looking to sell next year but I have their information and I write them notes and send them items of value. I am hoping it will generate a listing appointment at one day....
All I can say is &quot; Do What YOU Fear Most&quot;....
Thank to Tom Hopkins]]></description>

Jeff,  

Boy you sound like a bitter person. You need a little more sunshine in your life buddy! Life isn&#039;t all dark clouds. Open that door a little more and get some fresh air! Might change your attitude.]]></description>

Absolutely inappropriate to attempt to open someone&#039;s door.  However annoyed you may be makes no difference to a motivated agent.  Our attitude is &#039;next&#039; and it is true, we will wish you a great day and make $ building relationships with your neighbors and selling their home.]]></description>
