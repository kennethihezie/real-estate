					<description><![CDATA[I have been licensed as a Real estate agent/broker in Washington since 1979.  Over the years I have purchased land and houses and done some land development, paid the taxes and consider these purchases my inventory.  I intended to sell off over time to supplement retirement.  I am 82 and cannot afford to retire as the real estate taxes doubled here from 2007 to 2012.  Between the R E taxes and the insurances we pay (that includes long-term care as we do not want to burden anyone if we can not care for ourselves.  The rentals pretty well cover the expenses and leave enough to build a maintenance fund.  We only owe about $9000. on the real estate investments. We deduct the interest on that loan.

We both receive SS and want to know if the medical deductions are taxable?

My husband retired from the Air Force after 23 years and he has a pension that we are most grateful for.  He is 85 this year.  It seems to me that after paying income tax for sixty years we ought to be excused.  The record keeping in addition to the expense is almost unbearable and we can&#039;t afford a bookkeeper.  Thank you, Pat]]></description>
