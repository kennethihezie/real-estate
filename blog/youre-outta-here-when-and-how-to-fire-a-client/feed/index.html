This is why I don’t have buyers sign buyer agencies with me until they write an offer. That way, I’m not under any contract and if they become a waste of time, I can tell refer them to someone else easily.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Agent contracts are easily terminated by the agent. Its the other way around where agents and brokers get difficult. They can mess up indefinitely and you are a bad guy. There is a reason people hate realtors. They lie all the time. Near zero barrier to entry means anyone can be one thus usualy uneducated and unethical. Door unlocked, shoes on, late or no shows, dont answer questions, give sellers high price to get listing, waste months then say &quot;we need to drop the price&quot; as they relist in July with pictures of a snow covered roof .... on and on.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I got bad advice and fired a client rather suddenly - to him it was sudden, anyway. I thought I had forewarned of it. But after I rather unceremoniously informed him, he panicked, complained about me to my broker, and made me feel like a prisoner by refusing to &quot;let me go&quot;. I found out the hard way that you can&#039;t just leave a client, no matter how toxic the exchanges get, if they won&#039;t agree to terminate.]]></description>
