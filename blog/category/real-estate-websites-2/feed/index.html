										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Search Engine Optimization &amp; Building Backlinks Can Grow Your Real Estate Brand Online</h1>
<p>Real estate is a game of hustle. Show those homes, negotiate those deals, close those sales. It’s a competitive space with a lot of players and every agent needs to do what they can to <a href="/blog/real-estate-agents-need-a-brand/">stand out from the crowd</a>.</p>
<p>To ensure you get the most success for your hustle, you need to make sure prospective clients find you online. To get to the top of Google’s search results, you need three things: a fast-loading, mobile-friendly site; a navigation scheme Google can easily crawl; and a very strong profile of backlinks.</p>
<p>Think of a backlink profile like your reputation with Google, where it finds which sites linked back to you and assigns you a benchmark known as domain authority.</p>
<h2>Take Inventory</h2>
<p>The first step to improving your search presence is understanding where your website stands at the moment. Do you have hundreds of links to your site? What quality of websites link back to you – spammy microsites or respectable directories? Are the links embedded over relevant keywords or inane text?</p>
<p>It’s important to know because links from trusted sites boost your search ranking, while links from spammy microsites will drag you down.</p>
<p>This assessment process is what’s known as a <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/backlink-audit/">backlink audit</a> and usually requires tools like Google Analytics, SEMRush, or Ahrefs, but it can be <a href="https://searchengineland.com/performing-manual-backlink-audit-step-step-248276">done manually</a>. Some tools simply present you with a list of sites and you need to evaluate the quality yourself, while others provide information on their domain health. You’ll want to find the tool that best fits your specific needs and budget.</p>
<p>Next, address the sites that are dragging down your domain authority, contact these harmful sites and ask them to remove their links to your site. Otherwise, you’ll need to put together a <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2648487?hl=en">disavow report</a> with those links included and request that Google have them removed.</p>
<p>If you’ve recently changed your site domain or navigation format, for instance, if your ‘About’ page used to be at yoursite.com/about-us and now it’s at yoursite.com/about, check for outdated links out there, contact the referring sites and kindly ask them update the links with the new versions. Otherwise, visitors will get 404 error, which will drag you down in search results.</p>
<h2>Break Ground</h2>
<p>After cleaning house and ridding yourself of toxic links, it’s time to get proactive. Search algorithms will reward you for links that not only come from sites with high domain authority, but also links on pages that are relevant to your business. This includes factors like location, your specialty (luxury, vacation, commercial), and the <a href="https://www.semrush.com/blog/what-is-anchor-text-and-how-can-i-optimize-it/">anchor text</a> which is the literal text the link is embedded on.</p>
<p>Collect a list of websites that you think would offer valuable links to your site, ideally focusing on professional &amp; general directories, news &amp; industry media, and associations. You can use tools like Ahrefs or Moz’s Open Site Explorer to assess the domain health of your list and rank them accordingly.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-56477 size-full" src="https://www.marketleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SEMRush-1.png" alt="" width="2481" height="1773" /></p>
<h6 style="text-align: center;">Source: SEMRush</h6>
<p>Start by getting listed on sites like Zillow, the Chamber of Commerce, and the Yellow Pages. These should be easy wins on sites with incredibly high domain authority and visibility, which would mean very good things your site.</p>
<p>Another avenue is to share any news related to your business, like listing announcements, moving offices, or <a href="/blog/3-ways-for-real-estate-agents-to-win-the-hearts-of-their-community">doing good in your community</a>, via media pitches and press releases. News sites are visited very frequently, which gives them strong domain health, and online press releases function like permanent webpages that host the links you put in and reside on sites with high domain authority.</p>
<p>Some drawbacks to this approach are distribution sites for publishing press releases often charge per release and you won’t always have newsworthy updates to promote, so take advantage when you can &#8211; forcing matters to be newsworthy won’t serve your business.</p>
<h2>Deliver on Quality</h2>
<p>The last step you can take to build a strong backlink profile is to produce good content on your site that others will want to refer to. This can be content that’s designed to be evergreen in its usefulness or so compelling that it gets shared and referenced on other sites.</p>
<h3>Some examples of valuable, share-worthy content:</h3>
<ul>
<li>A to-do list for first-time homebuyers</li>
<li>Guide to getting the highest price for your home</li>
<li>Renovation ROI on sale price</li>
<li>Community resources</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re able, try to make your website a destination for members of your community. That traffic will not only boost your domain authority, but you’ll benefit from other people linking back to your content.</p>
<p>Be sure to research your competitors’ sites to see what tactics they employ and check their domain authority periodically to see how it’s working. If it is, emulate; if it isn’t, get creative and you’ll outrank them pretty quickly.</p>
<p>Building a strong backlink profile requires ongoing effort – it can’t be done overnight. It may seem taxing and not worth the effort at first, but over time you’ll find more leads on your website, organically, as you rise in the search rankings.</p>
<p>There’s no need to splurge on expensive billboards or get your face on every bench in town. Landing at the top of prospective clients’ searches is sure to drive much more business your way in the long run.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fundamentally, search engine optimization (or SEO) is about making search engines happy &#8211; convincing them that they should send their users to your website by placing your website’s pages higher in their search engine results pages.</p>
<p>The higher your website’s pages rank in search engine results pages, the more likely they are to get clicked on by search engine users. This is the ultimate goal of SEO &#8211; to get more people to visit your website from search engines. (This form of non-paid website traffic is also called “organic” traffic.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately for newcomers, SEO is an incredibly deep and complicated subject. There are thousands of very smart and talented people who have devoted their careers to SEO, and there are more SEO blogs, books, consultants, and thought leaders than you can shake a stick at.</p>
<p>Intimidated by SEO? <strong>Don’t be. </strong>You don’t need to be an SEO guru to generate organic traffic for your website. Just like you don’t need an MBA from a prestigious university to start and manage a successful business, it’s possible to attain a healthy amount of organic traffic for your website if you adhere to some basic web design and content principles.</p>
<h2>Make More Commission Income &#8211; for Free &#8211; Using SEO</h2>
<p>The reason why organic traffic is so important, and why people care about SEO so much, is that organic traffic is free. (Beyond the monetary and time costs associated with creating your website and its content, of course.) This arrangement is infinitely preferable to paid advertising, where every incremental visitor has a cost directly associated with them, or traffic from referral relationships, which are typically difficult and time-intensive to create.</p>
<p>Real estate professionals can therefore generate more leads and, in turn, increase their commission income <strong>for free</strong> simply by boosting the amount of people who organically visit their websites from search engines.</p>
<p>However, it’s important to remember that SEO isn’t a tool or trick you can use to game search engines. Rather, it’s a set of fairly basic best practices related to the design and content of websites.</p>
<p>This is why simply <strong>having </strong>a website isn’t enough. <a href="http://www.marketleader.com/products/professional-for-agents/">Like the agent-branded websites Market Leader provides</a>, your website must set you up for success from the get-go, in terms of adhering to design and content best practices that will help you generate (and, importantly, convert) organic traffic.</p>
<h2>SEO Is Like a Busy Retail Street</h2>
<p>To better illustrate what SEO is, think of a small-town shoe shop on a busy street lined with retail stores in the pre-Internet era. In order to stay in business, the owner of this shoe shop needs to figure out how to get people to enter their store and buy their shoes.</p>
<p>One option for accomplishing this is paid advertising. The shoe shop owner can buy newspaper, radio, and TV advertisements to increase exposure for their business or spread the word about sales and promotions. Unfortunately, not everyone has the budget or expertise for advertising. This shoe shop owner, like many small business owner, has neither of those requirements.</p>
<p>Another option is to adhere to the best practices for optimizing retail stores like shoe shops so that they draw in as many people inside from off the busy retail street as possible. These people are a free source of new business; beyond the cost of any in-shop changes or additions the shoe shop owner makes, it doesn’t cost them a dime to bring these potential new customers in from off the street.</p>
<p>So how does this shoe shop relate to SEO? In this example, the shoe shop is your website. The newspaper, radio, and TV advertisements are the many online paid advertising options available to agents. The flow of people who stroll down the busy retail street are search engine users. By optimizing your shoe shop (website) using certain best practices, you can do a better job convincing people on the street (search engine users) that they should become your customers (or visit your website).</p>

<h2>SEO Is Particularly Important for Agents</h2>
<p>As you’re undoubtedly already aware, the Internet is incredibly important for generating new business across the vast majority of industries. This is especially true for the real estate industry.</p>
<p>Looking at listings and getting market data, which used to be a chore for consumers, is now made exceptionally easy by the Internet. It’s possible to do both from the comfort of your own home, or even while you’re on the go by using a smartphone.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Consumer-using-laptop-computer.jpg" alt="SEO is particularly important for real estate agents" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-full wp-image-50105" />The Internet is also important for real estate professionals because the majority of consumers start their research online. For example, a relatively recent NAR survey found that about 90 percent of home buyers start their home buying journey on the Internet. Given that the majority of consumers work with the first agent they connect with, it’s incredibly important for agents do all they can to make first contact with prospective buyer and seller clients &#8211; using the Internet &#8211; before other agents do.</p>
<p>Using SEO to dominate search engine results pages for local real estate-related keywords, like “Seattle homes for sale” and “Seattle real estate,” can therefore greatly help an agent’s business.</p>
<h2>Understanding How Search Engines Work</h2>
<p>Just like any newbie agent needs to learn about the mindsets of home buyers and sellers, any agent being introduced to SEO should also learn how search engines actually work.</p>
<p>The fundamental purpose of search engines is to guide users to the web content they’re looking for. Search engines survive by successfully serving up the webpages that their users want. Google is the world’s most-used search engine, with about a 65 percent market share of the world’s total search queries, primarily because it provides the best search results for its billions of users.</p>
<p>So how does Google determine where to place your website’s pages in its search engine results pages? Google has several hundred ranking factors that range from things on your website (called on-page ranking factors), like the usage of keywords in page titles, to things off your website (called off-page ranking factors), including the number of links pointing your website from other websites.</p>
<p>No one knows exactly what all of these ranking factors are or precisely how important each one is. However, through observation, search engine optimizers have a very good idea of what the most important ranking factors are, and this provides us with the valuable best practices mentioned throughout this article.</p>
<p>To make matters more complicated, search engines constantly update their algorithms, which are the formulas that determine where pages should rank in search results. Because of these algorithm updates, websites can experience dramatic fluctuations in the amount of organic traffic they receive, even if no substantial changes are made to them from an SEO perspective.</p>
<p>Algorithm updates are made to better serve up the content search engines’ users are looking for. On the whole, they’re undeniably a good thing. Spammy SEO strategies that used to work very well, like <a href="http://www.kickstartcommerce.com/link-wheels-bad-seo-strategy.html">“link wheels”</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyword_stuffing">“keyword stuffing,”</a> caused search engines to often deliver unhelpful search results. Thanks to algorithm updates, these spammy strategies are now detrimental to the websites that still use them.</p>
<p>Given the sheer volume of ranking factors that exist, and that search engine algorithms are constantly changing, anyone who tells you there’s just one thing you need to know about SEO, or that they know a trick that will give you all the organic traffic you could possibly want, they’re either lying or don’t know what they’re talking about.</p>
<h2>Three Vital Things to Remember About SEO</h2>
<p>Let’s face it: You’re a real estate professional, not a digital marketing expert. You have an exceptionally busy schedule closing deals with home buyers and sellers, so you probably only have the time and bandwidth to learn the most salient points about SEO.</p>
<p>Here are the three most important things for you to remember about SEO:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Put people first.</strong> Ultimately, the webpages that get the most organic traffic from search engines are the ones that are most appealing to actual humans.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on high-quality content and design.</strong> You can excel at SEO &#8211; generate a ton of organic traffic &#8211; without being an expert on that subject if you focus on creating high-quality content and adhering to basic design principles.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t try to fool search engines.</strong> It’s dangerous to think of SEO as something you can use to game search engines. Most SEO tricks you’ll hear about don’t work anymore, if they ever worked at all. If there are SEO tricks that do currently work, they likely won’t work for long. Don’t listen to anyone who tells you otherwise!</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Develop Effective Messaging and Calls to Action</h2>
<p>It has always been important to have clear and compelling messaging in print collateral and advertising, and the same is also true for the messaging that appears on your website.</p>
<p>The foundation for compelling messaging is well-developed and organized copy. Begin pages you want to capture visitors’ contact information on with a compelling headline, followed by body copy where key points are neatly summarized in a sentence or short bulleted list, and then place a call to action at the end.</p>
<p>Research has demonstrated that the headline is most critical for generating conversions, followed by the call to action, and then the body copy. It’s important to recognize that your website’s visitors will often scan the first three words of sentences and paragraphs rather than taking the time to read them in entirety.</p>
<p>The following are some additional copy formatting and styling best practices that improve conversion rates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make page titles clean and simple.</li>
<li>Keep the first paragraph short &#8211; no more than two lines.</li>
<li>Use important words related to what consumers are most interested in at the beginning of sentences.</li>
<li>Vary the length of paragraphs and use no more than four to five lines per paragraph.</li>
<li>Use readable sans-serif fonts (e.g., Arial, Helvetica, etc.).</li>
<li>Use different colors and bold fonts, but only do so sparingly or else your website (and, by proxy, you) will look amateurish.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we’ve covered the basics of copy formatting and styling, we can get to the fun (and challenging) part &#8211; creating a compelling message. The key here is to get inside your prospective clients’ heads. Research has found that people are motivated most by fear, love, and pain (either physical or mental). Bearing this in mind, use these principles when crafting your messaging:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus on your consumers’ pain points and address them when describing the services you provide.</li>
<li>Be specific and express urgency with both your messaging and calls to action.</li>
<li>Sharing past clients’ testimonials provides third party validation for the services you offer. Communicate the value these past clients received and how their pain was alleviated in the process.</li>
<li>Try to include calls to action “above the fold,” or visible to your website’s visitors without them having to scroll down the page.</li>
<li>Test everything, from headlines to calls to action. The testing process should involve trying something new, measuring the results, making refinements to your original alteration based on the changes (positive or negative) that you observe, and then repeating this process.</li>
<li>Avoid using the generic “click here” for your call to action links in favor of something more specific.</li>
<li>If you’re not using buttons to make your call to action links visually distinct, highlight them by altering their font color or by making them bold.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Optimize Lead Forms and Registration Process</h2>
<p>For a variety of reasons, there is significant drop-off within lead forms and website registration processes. Visitors can get interrupted, stymied, or simply lose interest.</p>
<p>But this fact shouldn’t make real estate professionals any less determined to capture the contact information of their websites’ visitors. Having visitors’ phone numbers and email addresses provides agents with superb remarketing opportunities.</p>
<p>Adhere to the following best practices related to lead form and website registration optimization to increase your website’s ability to capture its visitors’ contact information:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have clear and concise form field labels.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Test what number of form steps maximizes conversions. Some websites find that using a multi-step process where few fields are shown in each step is more effective than having a one-step process where a ton of fields are visible.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>For multi-step forms, test placing form fields on different steps. For example, you may find overall conversions improve if you ask for visitors’ contact information on the last step.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>Let your website’s visitors proceed through the form submission or website registration process with simple “continue” or “submit” buttons.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>For multi-step lead submission or website registration processes, keep your website’s visitors informed of their progress with a progress bar.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
<li>Provide reassurance to your website’s visitors by letting them know that you adhere to a strict privacy policy of not selling their contact information.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="7">
<li>Use post-submission thank you and confirmation pages for additional marketing opportunities. At the very least, create links to other sections of your website (e.g., real estate listings or local market data) that will keep visitors interested in your services.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Develop HOT Opportunity Profiles for Target Consumers</h2>
<p>Most real estate professionals identify one or more types of consumers that they prefer to work with. This is ideal, as it allows them to focus their efforts and be more effective in generating &#8211; and then converting &#8211; their leads.</p>
<p>Agents can glean additional value from defining their target consumers by developing a “HOT (High Odds Target) Opportunity Profile.” HOT Opportunity Profiles are used to identify businesses’ most valuable customers by considering these three elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Demographics:</strong> Age, gender, geography, occupation, income, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Psychographics:</strong> Personality, interests, attitudes, and opinions.</li>
<li><strong>Behavioral patterns:</strong> Their actions and activities on your website.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you’ve developed HOT Opportunity Profiles for your target consumer types, it’s useful to define their conversion funnels so as to maximize your ability to convert them after capturing their information on your website. The marketing campaigns and website content you create to push prospective Millennial clients who are buying their first homes through your conversion funnel should look vastly different than what you create for Baby Boomers who are looking to downsize.</p>
<p>Of course, most consumers who visit your website will primarily be interested in real estate listings. These are equally interesting and applicable to all consumer profiles. But the materials you use to keep prospective clients from your different HOT Opportunity Profiles engaged after you’ve captured their information should vary dramatically. For example, while it’s smart to keep Millennial buyers engaged with emails about the quality of local schools, septuagenarian home buyers are much less likely to convert and become your clients if you send them the same information.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/3-strategies-for-improving-your-websites-conversion-rate/">3 Strategies for Improving Your Website’s Conversion Rate</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’ve all seen them: Websites that are supposed to sell, but wind up making their owners look dumb, inept or out of touch. We live in a digital era. According to the <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/reports/2014/2014-profile-of-home-buyers-and-sellers-highlights.pdf">2014 NAR Profile of Homebuyers and Sellers:</a></p>
<ul>
<li>92 percent of homebuyers use the Internet when looking for information</li>
<li>76 percent of buyers view homes or drive by homes for sale that they first find online</li>
<li>43 percent of buyers found their home on the Internet</li>
</ul>
<p>This business is tough enough, but if your website is making you look like you’re stuck in the 90s, while the rest of the real estate industry is moving on without you, you’re ceding a massive marketplace to competitors.</p>
<p>Here are eight vital signs your website presence needs a massive overhaul to catch up with the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p>
<h2>Have a Flash Intro on Your Website</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-45721" title="bad real estate website" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bad-real-estate-website-200x300.jpg" alt="Signs Your Website Is Stuck in the Dark Ages" width="200" height="300" />This is especially true if there’s text in the Flash imagery. Search engines can’t read text in a Flash animation. To the internet robots, they just look like image files. It’s like handing a photocopy of a braille book to a blind man and asking him to read it. It just doesn’t work. If you have text in a Flash piece, retype it into regular text. Then dump the Flash.</p>
<h2>Cheesy Glam Photos</h2>
<p>You’ve seen them. Photos of agents with 80s feathered hair that’s been out of style since Frankie went to Hollywood, complete with a pantyhose effect over the lens. Leave the glam shots for your high school yearbook, and go get a proper portrait done.</p>
<h2>Crummy E-mail Addresses</h2>
<p>Real estate agents are professionals. People entrust hundreds of thousands, even millions of dollars, to their care. If you have an email address like fairyangel1000@aol.com or harleydude51@yahoo.com, that’s one more item that undermines the trust that people have in you. Invest in a real email address and domain.</p>
<h2>No Lead Capture Functionality</h2>
<p>Not having this feature alone can kill your practice as a real estate agent. Consumers are now more used to entering basic information into a form, to give you permission to contact them. If a customer wants to see a house, they’ll be willing to let a professional agent contact them about it. Even if it doesn’t lead to an immediate sale, lead capture functionality is a key way of adding contacts to your drip marketing program. Plus, your lead capture system is a powerful defense against any accusation that you violated Do Not Call rules.</p>
<h2>Not Mobile Friendly</h2>
<p>Sure, you’ve had your site up for years. But have you actually looked at it on an iPhone? An Android phone or tablet? You need to do that regularly. Just because a site works on your desktop doesn’t mean it’s not loading up as gibberish on a mobile device.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-45751" title="consumer using smartphone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/consumer-using-smartphone-300x300.jpg" alt="Real estate website mistake: not being mobile-friendly" width="250" height="250" />When a potential homebuyer drives by one of your listings, sees your sign in front of the house and wants to look up the online listing, do you think they’re going to write the information down in a notebook and drive home to a big screen desktop? No! They’re going to look you up, on the spot, on their smartphone. If your site is legible and functional, and they’re interested, they’ll call you or drop their contact info in your lead capture system.</p>
<p>According to research by iAquire, 40 percent of users will give up if your site is not mobile friendly. You will never see or hear from them. Furthermore, 70 percent of searches on mobile sites lead to actions on websites within one hour.</p>
<h2>Bad Stock Photography</h2>
<p>Increasingly, consumers are accustomed to seeing homes marketed with beautiful imagery. Think of high-end magazine photography, like Real Simple and Architectural Digest<em>.</em> Your website’s top images should convey an elegant and refined look. Most cheap or free stock photo sites are nowhere near the industry standard. For the purposes of branding you and your business, invest in some proper images.</p>
<h2>Bad Agent Photography</h2>
<p>If you’re not a camera fiend, get a professional photographer to take photographs for you. Actually, you should probably do this anyway. You’re not a professional photographer – even if it’s a passion in your private life. You’re a real estate agent.</p>
<p>Every minute you spend setting up the perfect shot and tweaking the image on Photoshop is a minute better spent on the phone, talking to contacts and setting up listings, showings and closings. And counting your commission checks. Photography is a non-core activity for you. Delegate it as soon as you can. See more <a href="/blog/lessons-from-the-worst-real-estate-photographers/">tips on real estate photography</a>.</p>
<h2>Poor Social Media Integration</h2>
<p>It’s important for websites to have interactivity and to allow easy, seamless sharing of listings, blog posts, articles and other content via social media. If you spent time writing a great blog post or informative article, you’ve probably branded it with your name and contact information. If it’s useful, people will want to share it with friends. And if it makes you look like an expert, you want this information shared as much as possible. It builds your credibility and helps you grow your business. Make sure your social sharing tools are easy to find.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/8-signs-your-website-is-stuck-in-the-dark-ages/">8 Signs Your Website Is Stuck in the Dark Ages</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While some want you to believe that blogging is an art, it really isn’t. Anyone with thoughts in their head and a keyboard can construct a blog post. Being a successful real estate blogger, however, requires being mindful of the topics you choose and the construction of your blog posts.</p>
<p>Blogging is time intensive. But then, so is mailing out 1,000 postcards, cold calling or door knocking. If you’re considering ramping up your blogging efforts to reel in new clients in 2015, read on for some helpful tips.</p>
<h2>Why Should Agents Blog?</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-44201" title="real estate blogging" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/real-estate-blogging-2-300x289.jpg" alt="real estate blogging tips for beginners" width="300" height="289" />The biggest advantage to blogging is that – aside from what your time is worth – it’s free. If you waste that time by publishing garbage, or not posting on a consistent basis, then maintaining a real estate blog is actually quite expensive. This is why it’s so important that when you commit to the process, you follow through.</p>
<p>Once you’re up and running and consistently posting content about your local market, whether strictly real estate-related or not, local consumers will begin to visit your blog. You’ll also be able to show them your personality, so that they get to know, like and trust you.</p>
<p>If you’ve been in the real estate industry for over a week, you should know that there is no such thing as an overnight success. The key to blogging, as in most real estate lead generation techniques, is consistency. New leads probably won’t appear after your first post, but keep plugging away at it. It will take time for blog posts to generate web traffic – and leads. Be persistent and your efforts will pay off.</p>
<h2>Basics of Good Blog Design</h2>
<p>How many times have you left a website because the information you wanted was presented in a tiny font and one great big block of text? What your brain says is “Whoa, it’s a lot of work to read that.”</p>
<p>You’re in a hurry. You don’t have the time or desire to read all those scrunched-up words, and so you click away, knowing you’ll find the information somewhere else.</p>
<p>This is why the structure and design of your blog posts are just as important as what you write about. Concentrate on giving your reader lots of white space with short paragraphs.</p>
<p>Sub-heads are your friend. They act as a roadmap for the harried reader so that he or she understands what is coming next. They also add valuable white space. Consider breaking up long posts with bulleted lists and sprinkle the text with graphics and images.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><a href="/blog/social-seo-1-content-formatting-and-twitter-basics/"><strong><em>Learn more reader-friendly formatting tips here.</em></strong></a><strong><em></em></strong></p>
<h2>Punctuate and Capitalize Correctly</h2>
<p>Dump the exclamation points, please. “<em>Get pre-approved for a loan!”</em> is far too mundane to be considered an exclamatory sentence. Take a tip from the <a href="https://www.apstylebook.com/">Associated Press Stylebook</a>, every journalist’s bible. “Use the mark to express a high degree of surprise, incredulity or other strong emotion.”</p>
<p>Real Estate Agent shouldn’t be capitalized, nor should Listing Agent. In fact, your biggest worry should be to remember to capitalize the word REALTOR, and then you need a cap for every letter.</p>
<p>If it’s been awhile since high school or college, brush up on basic punctuation and grammar. Check out <a href="https://www.quickanddirtytips.com/grammar-girl">Grammar Girl, Punctuation Made Simple</a>, <a href="https://brians.wsu.edu/common-errors/">Common Errors in English</a> and the <a href="http://jacklynch.net/Writing/">Guide to Grammar and Style</a> if you need quick refresher courses.</p>
<h2>What Do I Write About?</h2>
<p>If you actively work with clients every day, keep track of questions they ask and problems they have. Answer those questions and solve those problems on your blog.</p>
<p>There’s no law, however, that says you <em>have</em> to write about real estate, as Elizabeth Newlin, agent with Realty ONE Group in Mesa, Ariz., well knows. “I write a <a href="http://realestatetangent.com/this-post-just-makes-me-sad-for-myself/">humor blog</a>,” she said.</p>
<p>“People think that a real estate blog should constantly be showing your knowledge of the market and I never do that,” Newlin continued. “I’ll write a couple of posts about things you should know about real estate, but I always do it tongue-in-cheek. For the most part I just write ridiculous stories.”</p>
<p>Those stories may be “ridiculous” to Newlin, but her audience hangs on her every word, and they’ve helped her build a real estate business based 100 percent on referrals.</p>
<h2>Put a New Spin on Popular Topics</h2>
<p>OK, so you don’t fancy yourself a funny guy or gal. If you’ve been blogging for some time, why not update some of your older posts that are proven traffic magnets?</p>
<p>“You can gather all the newest information on the topic, write a new post and then link back internally to the original post. It gives you both a brand new article on something formerly well received, and directs new readers (or old ones) to the first post you did on it. It’s great for traffic,” says Ann Smarty, brand and community manager at Internet Marketing Ninjas.</p>
<h2>Proofread, Proofread, Proofread</h2>
<p>After writing a post, put it away for a while. When you return to it, read it aloud to get a feel for how it sounds. If you like it, proofread it for spelling and grammar errors and you’re almost done.</p>
<h2>Write With SEO in Mind</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Fotolia_44888847_XS-300x208.jpg" alt="How real estate agents can improve their blog&#039;s SEO" title="real estate SEO" width="250" height="173" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-44251" />How will you ever show up above the fold on the first page of a Google search? I’m no <a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.com/en/us/webmasters/docs/search-engine-optimization-starter-guide.pdf">search engine optimization</a> (SEO) expert, but I have spoken with many specialists on the topic.</p>
<p>One thing they all agree on is to be cognizant of the placement of your keywords. “Keywords placed in important areas like titles, headlines, and higher up in the main body text may carry the most weight,” according to Cyrus Shepard, senior content “astronaut” at <a href="https://moz.com/blog/on-page-topic-seo">SEO and software company Moz</a>.</p>
<p>Most also agree that you need links in your blogs. These links should be both internal – linking to other pages on your site – and external. The latter not only helps your readers find more information on the topic, but search engines will see these links as useful as well.</p>
<h2>Final Touches</h2>
<p>Finally, push your blog posts out to social media to boost your readership. The more people who share your posts, the better your chances.</p>
<p>There’s a rumor in the real estate industry that 2015 is the year agents will finally get it. They will finally and fully “embrace content and inbound marketing,” writes marketing speaker Seth Price. “It’s still difficult for many in real estate to perceive the value in creating utility for consumers without turning that utility into an advertisement.”</p>
<p>“Publishing high quality content is the new equivalent of driving a Mercedes,” adds agent Anne Jones at Windermere Professional Partners. “You may not be selling million-dollar homes (yet!) but your marketing should look like you do.”</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/real-estate-blogging-tips-for-beginners/">Real Estate Blogging Tips for Beginners</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You may have heard about the destructive security bug, &#8220;Heartbleed,&#8221; that attacks a vulnerable flaw in major online security systems enabling it to access encrypted data. Warnings about Heartbleed are loud and alarming for good reason.</p>
<p>Please be assured, however: <strong>None of Market Leader&#8217;s systems have been affected by this security flaw. And none of the systems or services we provide to our customers or employees have been affected by this flaw.</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-29541" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Fotolia_63743415_S_copyright-150x160.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="160" />This doesn&#8217;t mean you should ignore the ever-increasing need for vigilance in protecting your data. The <a href="https://heartbleed.com/">Heartbleed Bug</a> launched about two years ago, and there&#8217;s no way for you to know what may have been compromised by this vulnerability, including Web, email, instant messaging, and some virtual private networks.</p>
<p>So we encourage you to practice good security measures, <strong>like remembering to change your online passwords. </strong>(Yea, yea, we know—it&#8217;s like hearing your dental hygienist reminding you to floss—but it&#8217;s gotta&#8217; be done!)</p>
<p><strong>Here are some excellent tips on protecting yourself and/or your brokerage</strong> along with links to more technical details and helpful information to use with your sphere of influence.</p>
<h2><strong>What can you do to protect yourself from Heartbleed?</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Change your passwords every few months. </strong>Especially passwords on financial accounts (banking, credit cards, etc.) and any site you regularly shop on. Before going to the trouble of changing all 250+ of your passwords, take a peek at the <a href="https://mashable.com/archive/heartbleed-bug-websites-affected">great list</a> Mashable.com put together to prioritize websites where you should consider changing your passwords.</li>
<li><strong>Be a little leery of public Wi-Fi networks.</strong> Your Internet behavior to non-transactional based or using websites that access financial information while on the Wi-Fi at Starbucks or other public places.</li>
<li><strong>If you have a VPN, use it. </strong>If your business or brokerage offers a virtual private network, or VPN, connect that way. It&#8217;s still fairly safe.<strong></strong></li>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t freak out. </strong>Sites like Amazon, Google, and other major Internet companies have already secured themselves and fixed the vulnerabilities disclosed this week. Still, changing your password is probably the best way to protect yourself and/or your business.</li>
<li><strong>Test to see which sites are vulnerable</strong>. Qualys® SSL Labs has created a Web app that will tell you what kind of encryption a site uses and whether the encryption is secure which can be found <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>What exactly is Heartbleed?</strong></h2>
<p>Heartbleed is a security flaw that was found on OpenSSL, a popular cryptographic library that is used to secure a huge chunk of the Internet&#8217;s traffic—basically any site that has “https” in the URL. Even if you have never heard of OpenSSL, chances are, it&#8217;s helped secure your data in some way.</p>
<h2><strong>How can you leverage this news with your contacts?   </strong></h2>
<p>As ActiveRain’s <a href="https://www.activerain.com/blogsview/4370309/heartbleed">Nikesh Parekh suggests</a>, blogging about the Heartbleed bug and sending an email to your contact database with a link to your blog post is a great opportunity to offer service to your prospects and customers.</p>
<h2><strong>Want more information about Heartbleed? Here are additional resources: </strong></h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-23081" title="Resolutions to Improve Your Business in 2014" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Fotolia_57684648_XS-300x200.jpg" alt="Real estate agents can boost their business in 2014 by improving their websites" width="300" height="200" />No matter where you are at this point in your real estate practice, chances are good that you’d like something more next year. More website hits, more referrals, and everything else that brings in more clients.</p>
<p>The end of a year is a good time to think about what you can add to your business plan to help you move up a notch or even to an entirely new level. To help you out, your friends at Market Leader will be offering up new resolutions in the coming weeks, any one of which will help to improve your real estate business in the year ahead. This week, we’ll look at ways to make your website a lead magnet in 2014.</p>
<h2>The Truth About Agent Websites</h2>
<p>While 70 percent of Realtors<strong>® </strong>have a website, their sites generate only 4 percent of their business, according to the National Association of Realtors<strong>®</strong> 2013 Member Profile. Sure, some agents generate over half their business from their websites, but those kinds of numbers take effort and money. If you’re looking for a better way to drum up business, consider taking the time and spending the money necessary to make 2014 the “Year of the Website.”</p>
<p>Most agents in the NAR survey spend an average of $220 a year to maintain their websites. Agents who “invested more heavily in their website reported a greater number of inquiries and business,” according to the study.</p>
<p>How much more heavily? Agents who spend $1,000 or more a year on maintaining their websites are an astonishing six times more likely to generate half of their business from the site than those who spend between $100 and $499.</p>
<h2>Kick Your Content Strategy Into Overdrive</h2>
<p>Every time Google tweaks its algorithm, “sites with sub-par content” lose visibility in the search giant’s rankings, according to Jayson DeMers, CEO of AudienceBloom. In fact, high-quality content is one of DeMers “Three Pillars of SEO.” The other two are links and social media.</p>
<p>If your site doesn’t have a blog (and only 12 percent of agent sites do), creating one should be first on your list of website makeover tips for 2014. But don’t build a blog without committing to updating it often. “Nothing looks worse than a <a href="https://www.searchenginewatch.com/2013/09/30/how-to-build-your-first-content-marketing-strategy/">blog that hasn’t been updated</a> in months,” warns DeMers at Search Engine Watch. “It represents a lack of care for customers and contributes to a negative overall impression.” It also gives the impression that you’re no longer in business.</p>
<p>Liken your blog to a Las Vegas casino. Once you walk in the door at the Bellagio, you’re likely to stay for hours. This isn’t by accident, but by design; the lack of clocks and natural light help patrons lose track of time, and thus spend more money. That, along with offering everything one could need during this time – food, drink, entertainment and lodging – further ensures they’ll stick around.</p>
<p>This should be the strategy behind building your blog. Real estate consumers are looking for two things: listings and information. The listings lure them to your site, the content, if done right, anchors them.</p>
<p>To become the Bellagio or MGM Grand of real estate bloggers requires that you provide helpful information on any topic a real estate consumer may be seeking. Don’t give them a reason to leave and find the information elsewhere.</p>
<p>New bloggers should consider writing blog posts to be a form of prospecting. To get into the blogging habit, set time aside every week to write the following week’s posts. While there are no formal rules for how long a post should be, or how often to post, the more often the better, according to Google gurus.</p>
<ul>
<li>Categorize your blog posts to address buying, selling, lending, staging and anything else that real estate consumers seek information about.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Set a goal for the number of posts you’ll write each week. Two to three are adequate.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that you fill each category somewhat evenly.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Push your content out to your social network.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Make it Mobile-Friendly</h2>
<p>Think about the first time you tried to pull up a website on your smartphone. If it wasn’t optimized, it most likely looked pretty awful. Just as the appearance of a home is all important to your buyer clients, so is the appearance of your website.</p>
<p>Since well over half of all American adults use smartphones, according to Pew Research Center’s Smartphone Ownership 2013 study, chances are good that many potential clients may be looking for homes on a mobile device.</p>
<p>In fact, if these tidbits from recent <a href="https://googlemobileads.blogspot.com/2012/09/mobile-friendly-sites-turn-visitors.html">Google research</a> don’t get you running to optimize your site for smartphones, nothing will.</p>
<ul>
<li>74 percent of those surveyed say they are more likely to return to a mobile-friendly site than one that isn’t.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A mobile-friendly site makes smartphone users “more likely to buy a product or use a service,” according to 61 percent of those researched.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>61 percent say that if they don’t find what they want right away on a mobile site they will quickly click to another site.</li>
</ul>
<p>The folks at Google suggest creating a better experience for your smartphone clients or potential clients by using big buttons and text on the site. Don’t inundate them with multiple steps to get to what they’re looking for, and make it fast.</p>
<p>Your website is just one aspect of your business that can help you prosper in 2014. Next week, we’ll look at more ways to kick your business to the next level.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/resolutions-to-improve-your-business-in-2014-beef-up-your-website/">Resolutions to Improve Your Business in 2014: Beef Up Your Website</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-18831" title="The Pros and Cons of National Real Estate Websites" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Fotolia_53571161_XS-300x245.jpg" alt="Agents have mixed feelings about the national real estate websites, but working with them can mean marketing to a much larger audience " width="300" height="245" />Sure, it may sound trite, but it’s nonetheless true: Agents have a love/hate relationship with the national real estate sites. ActiveRain is full of complaints from agents regarding the mistakes commonly found on the sites and about how chasing after these dead-end leads for their clients wastes precious time.</p>
<p>Love them or hate them, agents still need to deal with the national sites because, as one ActiveRain poster states, “You can spend all of the time and money you want on your own website but the big three are still going to get the <a href="http://activerain.com/blogsview/3476614/narep-forms-to-fight-abuse-of-the-big-3-in-listing-syndication#sthash.C7Ru2TWd.dpuf">major rankings</a>.”</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at some pros and cons of working with “the big three.”</p>
<h2>Pros</h2>
<p>Probably the biggest thing going for the national real estate sites is the fact that they rank at the top of most real estate-related Web searches. This means millions of real estate consumers visit these sites. That’s a lot of eyeballs to have on your brand.</p>
<p>Since most people don’t visit these sites unless they’re actively looking at property, their audience is most assuredly focused on real estate – another mark in favor of national real estate websites.</p>
<p>Most of the sites allow agents to restrict their ads to be seen only by consumers searching in a certain geographic area.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s the branding benefits that appearing on these sites provides. Whether agents like it or not, the big real estate sites lend agents credibility – and that’s what helps win more clients.</p>
<h2>Cons</h2>
<p>Standing out in a sea of other real estate agents is challenging, and most places that agents choose to market their businesses are heavily populated with other agents vying for the same client pool.</p>
<p>The national real estate sites are no different. The one saving grace is that many real estate agents find it difficult to part with money, so if a site charges to advertise, there will be less competition than you’ll find on free sites. Consider the enormous amount of competition you find in the Craigslist real estate section compared to what you find on Trulia, for instance.</p>
<p>Another problem agents find with the national real estate sites is the amount of inaccurate or outdated information. Many of them don’t use MLS data, so home values quoted on the site may differ wildly from those you present to your listing client in your CMA. Agents complain that since these sites bill themselves as the experts, when figures vary, it erodes the trust they’ve worked so hard to build with their client.</p>
<p>Then there are the homes advertised as available when they aren’t, and the time the agent wastes following up on these for his client.</p>
<p>Finally, the cost of advertising on these sites is prohibitive for many agents. How much you’ll spend depends on the site and your area. Like any advertising campaign, however, you’ll need to give the process from three to six months and track your performance during that time period. You’ll also need to follow up and remain responsive to capture the leads.</p>
<h2>Does it Work?</h2>
<p>“My experience in this market is that Zillow and Trulia at least are excellent ways for me to allocate my <a href="http://activerain.com/blogsview/3819968/online-real-estate-advertising#sthash.mov2zmST.dpuf">advertising dollars</a>,” claims Scott Larson, a Park City, Utah agent in a response to a post at ActiveRain.</p>
<p>“I have already closed one deal that will pay for all of my advertising at my current level of commitment for the next four years with several more in the pipeline,” he continues. “So far I would say that about 25 to 35 percent of my leads through these sources are good leads,” Larson concludes.</p>
<p>The flip side to this comes from Noah Seidenberg, Chicago agent and reviewer on <a href="http://activerain.com/product-reviews/sales-marketing/lead-generation-referrals/zillow-agent-advertising/126#sthash.nM7QrQ6w.dpuf">ActiveRain</a>: “You can do better on ActiveRain for 20 or 40 bucks then you can do in Zillow for hundreds. I tried it and got leads that were asking about homes already under contract, sold or off the market for years.”</p>
<p>National real estate sites can be a great source of leads if “you actually know how to work a lead,” according to Missouri agent Jeremy Johnston. We might also add that it helps to have a system in place to assist you in turning the leads into sales.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/the-pros-and-cons-of-national-real-estate-sites/">The Pros and Cons of National Real Estate Websites</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-18111" title="SEO Tips for Real Estate Agents" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Fotolia_44888847_XS-300x208.jpg" alt="Real estate agents can use SEO to improve online marketing " width="300" height="208" /></a>Organic – it’s not just what’s for dinner. Like organic food, however, organic traffic to your website is obtained naturally – without paying for it or having it referred from a directory or another site.</p>
<p>In fact, organic traffic is sent to your site because the search engines “think” your site is interesting or relevant to the search terms. They like you &#8211; they really like you.</p>
<p>Since not every real estate agent can make it to the front page of Google, the question of the millennium is: “Why not?”</p>
<h2>Why Doesn’t My Site Show Up in Google?</h2>
<p>Google uses a long list of criteria – over 200 factors – to determine which pages rank for which search terms. The whole process is bundled in what is known as an algorithm, defined by Google as “&#8230; computer programs that look for clues to give you back exactly what you want.”</p>
<p>When a user enters a search term, the algorithm clicks and whirs and tries to guess what the user wants to see. It does this by considering terms on the site, how fresh the content is, what region the searcher is in, and &#8220;page rank.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, although just owning a website and publishing it to the Web doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll automatically rank, it is the first step.</p>
<h2>Organic Traffic Isn’t “Free”</h2>
<p>Earlier we defined organic traffic as being that which you don’t have to pay for. Although that makes it sound as if it’s free, don’t be fooled.</p>
<p>It takes time and effort to optimize your website for search engines – to have the content and links that Bing and Google find rank-worthy.  Because your time is better spent drumming up clients, chasing after organic Web traffic can actually be quite expensive.</p>
<p>Then, consider that there are no guarantees that all that work will pay off and put you above all the other agents in town when someone is searching for an agent.</p>
<h2>Tips to Improve Your Ranking</h2>
<p>Let’s take a look at some ways to nudge you ahead in Bing’s and Google’s rankings.</p>
<h3>Compelling Content</h3>
<p>Market Leader’s senior trainer, Shannon Shimabukuro, suggests beefing up your content. If you’re just starting a website, ensure that the content you use is “relevant, fresh and unique” so that it provides value for the user and positions you as the hyper-local expert.</p>
<p>Don’t just promote your latest listings, but tell readers what’s so great about living in your area. Let them know about interesting restaurants, the best dog parks in the area, where to get the best cup of coffee or hamburger. Sprinkle in advice on homebuying and selling.</p>
<p>This isn’t a one-time task. Content has to remain fresh, which means you’ll need to spend time (or pay someone else) to make consistent updates to your content library.</p>
<h3>Use Target-Audience Keywords</h3>
<p>Think of keywords as a breadcrumb trail that will lead potential clients to your website.</p>
<p>The keywords can be anything that your potential clients will enter into the search box when looking for an agent or a home. These keywords need to not only show up in your content, but in your page titles and images as well.</p>
<p>Shimabukuro cautions against “trying to rank for popular real estate search queries,” and recommends using hyper-local terms instead. For example, you’ll get a lot more hits using “condos in Hayes Valley” than you will for “San Francisco real estate.”</p>
<p>Finally, Shimabukuro cautions against the overuse of keywords; you don’t want to risk being considered a spammer by the search engines. She recommends using three to five phrases per page.</p>
<h3>Links</h3>
<p>The Miss Congenialities of Google have lots of links. Google’s algorithm takes a good look at the number and veracity of the sites that link to yours. Shimabukuro likens them to votes – the more links, the more popular the site. Link to your site from your blog and your social networking pages, and be sure to use your keywords when you create the links.</p>
<h2>Nothing in Life or on the Internet is Guaranteed</h2>
<p>The folks at <a href="https://moz.com/google-algorithm-change">Moz.com</a> claim that “Google changes its search algorithm around 500 to 600 times every year.” Not all of these changes have the impact of a Panda or Penguin update, but all you need is one big one to kick you back to where you started, leaving all your hard work in the dust.</p>
<p>While organic traffic is important, it’s just one aspect of a multipronged approach to Internet marketing.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/organic-traffic-isnt-free-beginner-seo-tips-for-agents/">Organic Traffic Isn’t Free: Beginner SEO Tips for Agents</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While a website must express a company’s brand, services and products (properties), it should also entertain the visitor up to a certain point. Boring, unprofessional and confusing websites make for bad storefronts for real estate businesses. It’s like walking into a store littered with products or lacking any employees. Generally, people will walk out and never return. Ineffective websites alienate customers, so it’s absolutely critical for real estate businesses to take an objective approach when designing or redesigning their website to enhance their customers’ experience.</p>
<h2>Who is Your Audience?</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-9581" title="create an engaging real estate website" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Fotolia_47753777_XS.jpg" alt="create an engaging real estate website" width="288" height="287" />You must figure out your target market or audience before you can create an engaging website. According to Christian K. Nordtømme, Creative Director at <a href="http://nextpage.no.">Next Page</a>, “Real estate brokers and agents have two audiences: sellers, who need to be convinced that they&#8217;ll get the best price possible for their treasured home, and buyers, who need to know they&#8217;re getting a great deal. The website needs to hit home with both audiences.”</p>
<p>Not every design or layout works for every customer. Likewise, your website should appeal to your target market. For instance, those selling modern designed properties will have a greater chance of customer engagement by choosing a website design that incorporates a streamlined, contemporary look. Create a website that mirrors the types of properties that you sell or your customer base.</p>
<h2>High Quality Photos</h2>
<p>Poor quality photos will not attract customers or keep them engaged.  According to Justin Hughes, co-founder of <a href="http://www.realtymogul.com">Reality Mogul</a>, “Quality photos will hook your visitors’ interest much more effectively than low-resolution or otherwise poor-quality photography. They will be much more likely to dive into the text when it is accompanied by high-quality imagery, and let&#8217;s face it, real estate metrics can be very bland.” Using high quality photos in some cases is easier said then done. Investing in a digital camera or hiring a photographer to shoot a home can make all the difference in the world when designing a visually pleasing website.</p>
<h2>Reduce Friction</h2>
<p>Requiring visitors to take a number of steps while going through your website is a good way to get them to leave. “Don&#8217;t require users to perform a bunch of actions in order to do the things they want. Each step or required action is a potential point where a user will drop off. If it is a pain to engage with your site, people will just move on because, at a certain point, it is no longer worth it to them. Allow them to do what they want with as little friction as possible and your engagement rates will soar.”</p>
<p>You wouldn’t want to visit someone who had you perform chores, fill out paperwork or reveal personal information. Don’t make your visitor work for information. Everything on your website should be a click away. Likewise, give people the ability to go back to the home page from every page. Visitors will not return of they are easily lost on your website.</p>
<h2>User Interface for Your Website</h2>
<p>Good user interface allows customers to easily complete tasks like signing up for a newsletter, viewing listings, reading website content or making selections. People have certain expectations about navigating on a website. Clearly designed categories and secondary links allow the user to access information. “Don&#8217;t try and reinvent the wheel with your UI. Unless you really nail it, you run the risk of breaking people&#8217;s expectations, and they will feel frustrated when trying to perform common actions in their usual way. Also, try not to overload [users] with choices. Keep things simple and make the most common actions obvious with higher-priority ordering in your UI.”</p>
<p>Design your website for the user and not for any aesthetic reasons. Navigate your own website from a user perspective to determine if any changes need to be made.</p>
<h2>Rewards</h2>
<p>Reward visitors for coming to your website. This doesn’t mean offering coupons or special offers. In fact, you can reward your customer with engaging content, high quality photos, easy access to pertinent information or gamification. “Gamification is a broad term used to describe any form of UX (user experience) where a user is rewarded for engagement. This can be as simple as profile badges for top contributors or giving points to users when they comment on posts,” says John Hughes.</p>
<p>You can also increase visitor engagement by responding to comments or questions. As many real estate businesses find, customers feel engaged when the website has been tailored and thoughtfully created for them. While promoting your brand is essential, engaging your customer will establish a strong bond that can lead to a quality customer base.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/how-to-keep-customers-engaged-on-your-website/">How to Keep Customers Engaged on Your Website</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>
