										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After learning some best practices, your new perspective on cold calling may surprise you.</p>
<p>It gets a bad rap. But if you know what you’re doing, it’s less intimidating and more productive.</p>
<p>Regardless of what you’ve heard or imagined, real estate cold calling can still be an effective lead generation strategy. That’s true even though it is “old school,” and even if there are many ways to fail.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Why Cold Calling Is Still Worthy of Consideration</h2>
<p>If real estate cold calling seems like an old-fashioned strategy, that’s because it is. But like <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/real-estate-direct-mail/">direct mail marketing</a> and <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/door-knocking-real-estate/">door knocking</a>, there’s a reason it’s been a common sales tactic for as long as it has: it works.</p>
<p>Let’s be honest. Upon first glance, the statistics about how good of an ROI cold calling offers aren’t encouraging. For example, <a href="https://www.zippia.com/advice/cold-calling-statistics/">a recent study</a> indicated that roughly one in three prospects will pick up when you call, and only one percent of cold calls will lead to an appointment.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t show the whole picture. Because many top-performing agents consider cold calling to be an essential part of their business plan. They’ve filled their pipelines by “dialing for dollars,” and it’s led to serious commission income increases year after year.</p>
<p>This discrepancy seems to highlight an important point: Real estate cold calling isn’t just a numbers game. Success comes as a result of discipline, hard work, and a bit of technique. Not plugging away until you experience some random luck.</p>
<p>Top-performing agents know how to capitalize on the few opportunities they get. They know how to get warm leads out of cold calls. And that’s doable for you, too, as long as you follow some tried-and-true techniques.</p>
<p>So let’s dive into the best practices so you can be among the many expert agents who leverage cold calling to close more deals.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">8 Pro Tips for Real Estate Cold Calling</h2>
<h3 class="BlogH3">1. Understand the Law</h3>
<p>Cold calling in real estate isn’t foolproof. There are many ways it can go wrong. Getting into legal trouble is among the worst ways to fail.</p>
<p>The Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TPCA) was created in 1991 to protect consumers from pesky telemarketers. It applies to “any person, business, or entity that conducts telephone solicitations,” which includes real estate agents.</p>
<p>The TCPA is important to mention here because both the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have the regulatory powers to enforce it. The last thing you want as a result of trying to generate leads is a lawsuit.</p>
<p>And beware: today there are more than 220 million numbers on the FCC’s official <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/topics/do-not-call-registry">Do Not Call Registry</a>. If you call numbers on the registry, you could face a fine of up to <a href="https://www.rd.com/list/truth-about-do-not-call-list/">$40,000</a> for each call.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for you? Essentially it means you need to comply with the following:</p>
<ul class="BlogUL">
<li class="BlogLI">Restrict your calls to hours between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Be transparent: immediately tell the recipient who you are and the name of your business</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Don’t block your phone number from the recipient’s caller I.D.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Search the registry for every cold call you make to ensure you aren’t contacting anyone who’s on that list</li>
</ul>
<p>For more details about how to cold call in real estate without breaking the law, <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/telemarketing-cold-calling">check out NAR’s quick summary</a>.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">2. Prepare</h3>
<p>Do the proper research before you call so you can speak knowledgeably about your prospect’s situation and provide thorough responses to any questions that might come up. For example: if you’re cold calling a potential seller, familiarize yourself with the neighborhood, know the area’s <a href="https://www.realtor.com/research/market-trends/">median listing price</a>, and compile a handful of nearby listing comps for reference.</p>
<p>Prepare your lines beforehand. Use <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2022-Call-Scripts-Guide.pdf">the most effective real estate call scripts</a> and adjust them to fit your personality and the specific situation.</p>
<p>Then practice. Rehearse your main talking points. Call yourself and leave a voicemail to assess your delivery.</p>
<p>Ask a friend, family member, or colleague to play the role of an inquisitive consumer so you can practice fielding questions, addressing concerns, and handling objections. Work toward sounding as natural as possible.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">3. Resist the Urge To Sell</h3>
<p>Be relational, not salesy. No one wants to feel like they’re being used to boost your bottom line. So be friendly and provide value. Demonstrate that you actually care about them as a person.</p>
<p>How can you do that? By listening to what they say, taking notes, and repeating their own words back to them throughout the conversation. Tailor your approach specifically to their pain points and show how you’re the agent who can provide the help they need.</p>
<p>Your ultimate goal, of course, is to turn them into a client. But that’s not what this call is about. You’re not going to sign any contracts after a single phone call.</p>
<p>Instead, focus on being genuinely helpful, and replace your ultimate goal with a much smaller one for the time being: to get them to take the next step (which, for example, might be something as simple as scheduling a follow-up call).</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">4. Set a (Realistic) Daily Cold Calling Goal</h3>
<p>Aiming for 500 cold calls a day is admirable, but it’s also a recipe for burnout.</p>
<p>First, establish your commission income goals. Then determine how many calls you’ll need to get there.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say you want to earn $75,000 this year in commissions and you’re on a 10 percent split with your broker. That means you’ll need to close slightly less than $2.8 million worth of real estate sales. (The breakdown: $75,000 of total commissions income ÷ 90% to account for the split ÷ 3% if that’s the transaction commission rate.) If the median sale price of a home in your area was $285,000, you’d need to close 10 deals a year to reach (and slightly exceed) your commission goal.</p>
<p>(If you want the quickest, easiest way to find out how many leads you’ll need to reach your annual income goal, use Market Leader’s free <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/leadcalculator/">Lead Calculator</a>. Simply punch in the numbers you’re aiming for, and the calculator will tell you how many transactions and leads you’ll need across all lead sources.)</p>
<p>Also, this is where investing in your <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/solutions/crm/">CRM</a> pays off. Analyze the data it provides to determine how many contacts it took you to generate the deals you closed last year.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">5. Call at the “Right Time”</h3>
<p>If you still don’t feel all warm and fuzzy about real estate cold calling, consider getting it out of the way as soon as possible so you can avoid procrastinating. Many agents like to make telephone prospecting the first thing they do every morning so they can get it off their mind and their to-do list.</p>
<p>Is that the best time to call? It could be. But as long as you comply with the FCC’s limitations, of course, any time may be a good time for you and your prospects.</p>
<p>You could go the route of following the statistics. For example, findings from <a href="https://www.revenue.io/blog/the-best-time-to-cold-call-prospects-in-2020">one recent study</a> suggested that “decision makers are more likely to engage in the late afternoon,” with engagement rates peaking “during the 4-5 p.m. hour.” And data from <a href="https://www.execvision.io/blog/best-time-cold-call/">another study</a> showed that “the best time to cold call a prospect is between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., with 10 a.m. (15.53%) and 2 p.m. (15.01%) providing the best response times.”</p>
<p>Studies like those might provide a good starting point. But ultimately, you need to find what works best for you and your prospects. That’s going to require some trial and error.</p>
<p>Hypothesize about what might work best, give it a try, track your results, and repeat the process until you’ve found a time range that yields the highest results. Once you’ve identified the ideal times to call, make that a regular part of your schedule and stick to it.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">6. Demonstrate Your Value Immediately</h3>
<p>The prospect should immediately learn 1) who you are and 2) what you bring to the table. And they should know both of those things <em>before</em> they can even begin to consider objections.</p>
<p>Sharing who you are is easy – just start off the call by mentioning your name and, if applicable, the name of your business or brokerage. But how can you demonstrate your value?</p>
<ul class="BlogUL">
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Share a version of your unique value proposition</strong>, a statement that expresses how you’re different (and better!) than your competitors. (Don’t have one? <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/real-estate-marketing-plan/">Market Leader’s free real estate marketing plan</a> walks you through the process of creating a unique value proposition, vision statement, and mission statement.)</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Share your enthusiasm.</strong> Think of Theodore Roosevelt’s famous line: “Nobody cares how much you know until they know how much you care.” Demonstrating your level of expertise is very important (which is why it’s our next point), but it’s not the only thing that matters when cold calling – you also need to show that you have their best interest at heart. Your prospect is looking for an advocate and cheerleader, not just a consultant.</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Share what you know.</strong> By translating not only facts and figures but also your interpretation, insights, and conclusions based on the data, you’re essentially saying, “I’m the local expert, I’ve put in the hard work to understand this market at a granular level, and I’m bringing a kind of value that no other agent can provide.” It’s that kind of analysis that will put you leagues beyond what your prospects can find on Zillow.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="BlogH3">7. Be Memorable</h3>
<p>Not only are you competing with other agents, you’re also competing with all of the other things that take prospects’ time and attention away from buying or selling. So find your own unique way to stand out. Maybe for you it’s your personality, a catchphrase, a resource you provide, or a personal connection you share.</p>
<p>But remember: Ultimately, the call isn’t about you. It’s about helping the prospect. So as you’re capturing their attention, be careful not to push them aside. Always help your prospects draw a clear connection between what you do and how (exactly) that benefits them.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">8. Give Them the Next Steps</h3>
<p>After the call is over, they should know what’s going to happen next. End by scheduling a meeting, for example, or nailing down the best time for a follow-up call.</p>
<p>Is there a specific action you want them to take after the call? Tell them plainly. Depending on the situation, you might have one specific call to action (e.g., “Take a look at the listings on my website,” or “Check out this <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/what-is-a-cma-in-real-estate/">CMA</a> and let me know what you think”).</p>
<p>Or maybe the next step is something you will do (e.g., “I’m going to shoot you an email that walks you through the buying process…,” or “I’ll give you a call on Wednesday…”).</p>
<p>In any case, don’t end the call without providing clarity about who is doing what when.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are two ways to approach this.</p>
<p>You could create a real estate business plan to avoid failure. Many agents go that route and find some level of success. There’s nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p>But there’s another way. You could create a business plan, not just because it reduces the risk of failure, but because it maximizes your growth potential.</p>
<p>What follows is an invitation to do just that – to go through the process of refining intentionality, elevating accountability, and igniting motivation so you can be more productive. Year after year.</p>
<p>What if 2023 was the year you generated more leads and closed more deals than ever before? It’s possible. But only if you have a plan to follow.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">The Real Estate Business Plan Checklist</h2>
<p>To provide the big-picture view, here are the action items you’ll need to include in your plan for this year:</p>
<ul class="BlogUL">
<li class="BlogLI">Note learnings from 2022</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Calculate your expenses</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Set goals</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Create a marketing plan</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Develop a system for tracking your progress</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re going to take a close look at each. But if you want to hop on the fast track, download the <a href="#download">2023 Real Estate Business Plan</a> and you can get started right away. This free, interactive guide from Market Leader covers everything on that checklist and more. Plus, you’ll get downloadable templates for calculating expenses, setting goals, planning your marketing, and tracking progress.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">5 Year-End Reflection Questions To Consider</h2>
<p>Sometimes you have to look back before you can move forward. Use the questions below as a way to reflect on last year’s performance so you can identify your business’s strengths, weaknesses, and potential.</p>
<ol class="BlogOL">
<li class="BlogLI">Which aspects of my real estate business <strong>occupied most of my time and attention</strong> last year?</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Which aspects of my business <strong>performed best</strong> last year? (For example, maybe you received many referrals, responded quickly to leads, or executed a strong social media campaign.)</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Based on last year’s performance, which aspects of my business <strong>are most in need of improvement</strong>?</li>
<li class="BlogLI">What are the <strong>top two or three mistakes</strong> I made last year that I need to learn from for 2023?</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>What would “success” look like</strong> specifically for my business in 2023?</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Calculate Your Expenses</h2>
<p>Believe it or not, tracking your expenses is an important prerequisite to maximizing your gross commission income for 2023. If you have the right expense-tracking system in place, you’ll get more of your hard-earned income back at the end of the year.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to track all of your deductible business expenses. You may be surprised to learn about the <a href="https://outfront.kw.com/training/11-tax-deductions-every-real-estate-agent-should-know-about/">many ways you can reduce the amount you owe to the IRS</a>. For example, you might even be eligible to deduct expenses related to software, marketing, advertising, and lead generation. Refer to <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p535.pdf">IRS Publication 535</a> for details and be sure to consult with your CPA or financial advisor so you don’t miss out on any money-saving tips.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Two of the Best Ways to Track Your Expenses</h3>
<ul class="BlogUL">
<li class="BlogLI">Use an app. There are many free and low-cost options that allow you to categorize and track your expenses on the go. For example, check out <a href="https://www.spendee.com/">Spendee</a> or <a href="https://dollarbird.co/">Dollarbird</a>. They’re both simple and user-friendly, and they both have options to get you started for less than $5 per month.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Download the free “Expense Tracker” template in Market Leader’s <a href="#download">2023 Real Estate Business Plan</a>. It provides space for you to calculate your personal living expenses and all of your various business expenses all in one place.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Set Your Real Estate Business Goals</h2>
<p>Start by <strong>identifying your average commission per transaction</strong>. Multiply the <a href="https://www.realtor.com/research/market-trends/">median listing price in your area</a> by your commission percentage rate.</p>
<p>Once you’ve calculated your expenses and you’ve figured out roughly how much you’ll bring in from each transaction, you’ll be informed enough to establish an <strong>attainable income goal for 2023</strong>.</p>
<p>From there you can determine how many transactions you’ll need for the year.</p>
<p>The Formula: A ÷ B = C</p>
<p>A. Your 2023 Income Goal<br />
B. Estimated Commission Per Transaction<br />
C. Transactions Needed for the Year</p>
<p>To drill down even farther, check out Market Leader’s free <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/leadcalculator/">Lead Calculator</a>. Simply punch in the numbers you’re aiming for, and the calculator will tell you how many transactions and leads you’ll need across all lead sources to reach your income goal.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Create a Marketing Plan</h2>
<p>Maybe you’re on your way to “top-performer” status, but you don’t have a great plan for getting more clients and increasing your gross commission income. Or maybe you have a plan, but it’s not working.</p>
<p>Either way, you’ll benefit from learning how to <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/real-estate-marketing-plan/">craft a well-developed real estate marketing plan</a> that’s specifically designed to help you <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/products/real-estate-leads/">generate more leads</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick outline sketch of what that would look like in practical terms.</p>
<ul class="BlogUL">
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Build your brand.</strong> Establish a brand identity that includes a mission statement, vision statement, and a value proposition.</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Define your target market.</strong> You can’t be everything to everyone. If you try, your brand will end up blending in instead of standing out. So take the time to identify who fits within your audience.</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Collect data.</strong> When you’re armed with statistics, analytics, and insights, you’re better able to set goals, track progress, and make your success repeatable. Without data, your marketing efforts are more likely to be a complete gamble, if not a guessing game.</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Get marketing automation tools.</strong> With <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/products/professional-for-agents/">Market Leader Professional</a>, for example, you get a customizable, lead-generating website and a fully integrated CRM. Plus, you can automate new listing alerts and even create newsletters and content pieces like postcards, flyers, and video-enabled mobile-responsive emails.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Track Your Progress</h2>
<p>Why is performance-tracking necessary?</p>
<ul class="BlogUL">
<li class="BlogLI">It’s a way of <strong>holding yourself accountable</strong> to the goals you set.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">It provides you with the <strong>feedback</strong> you need to make strategic adjustments.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">It enables you to create <strong>new benchmarks</strong> for future goals.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">It takes the guesswork out of your <strong>professional self-reflection</strong>.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">It’s the most efficient way to <strong>spot what’s working well and what needs improvement</strong>.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">It helps you <strong>prioritize</strong> and keeps you focused on what matters most.</li>
</ul>
<p>It doesn’t have to be time-consuming and complicated. It can be as easy as creating a basic table in your favorite word processor or spreadsheet software, writing down all of your goals in the left column, and using the rest of the columns to note your performance each month (or week).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is a CMA in real estate?</strong></p>
<p>“CMA” stands for comparative market analysis, and it refers to the process of estimating a property’s value, based on the listing prices and sold prices of similar homes nearby and other data related to the local market.</p>
<p>Many agents either don’t know how to do a CMA (because they didn’t receive any training) or they don’t realize its importance. So it ends up being just another task on their long list of obligations.</p>
<p>But it can be (should be!) much more than that. This kind of analysis is extremely valuable, especially in today’s fast-moving, ever-changing real estate market. It’s one of the most important things separating real estate agents from Zillow.</p>
<p>Get ready to learn everything you need to know about performing comparative market analyses that benefit leads, clients, and agents alike, because this article walks you through how to do a CMA in four simple steps.</p>
<p>But before we get into the nitty gritty, let’s take a step back to consider the purpose. Why is a CMA in real estate even necessary?</p>
<p>Knowing how to create a CMA from start to finish is important. But having a clear understanding of the “why” is what will give you a significant boost over your competitors.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">How a CMA Benefits <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Consumers</span></h2>
<p>The benefit of a CMA for sellers (or potential sellers) is obvious. By comparing their home to similar homes that either just sold or are under contract, <strong>they can get a better idea of what their home is currently worth</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>But a CMA can also be a valuable point of reference for <em>buyers</em>.</strong> They don’t want to make an offer that’s too low, and they don’t want to overpay. A CMA helps them avoid both risks. It helps them size up their competition (by showing them what other buyers may be willing to pay for the home they’re interested in) while also giving them a clear boundary that shows how high is too high.</p>
<p>In any case, what consumers of all kinds are looking for is objectivity. They want to know without a doubt that a home’s value is derived from a valid, data-driven process. Why? Because it <strong>provides a sense of comfort</strong> during what is often a stressful time and it <strong>gives them confidence</strong> to make a move (pun intended).</p>
<p>The upcoming four-step process for creating a CMA in real estate will offer all of the aforementioned consumer-facing benefits.</p>
<p>But a CMA also benefits you as the agent. Here’s how.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">How a CMA Benefits <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Real Estate Agents</span></h2>
<p>Let’s start with the basics.</p>
<p><strong>A CMA is a great way to prove your value and establish credibility.</strong> By showing not only facts and figures but also your interpretation, insights, and conclusions based on the data, you’re essentially saying, “I’m the local expert, I’ve put in the hard work to understand this market at a granular level, and I’m bringing a kind of value that no other agent can provide.”</p>
<p><strong>A CMA gives you the confidence you need to negotiate like a top-producer.</strong> You can rest on the power of objectivity instead of the weakness of personal opinion. It’s difficult to dismiss an offer or counter a price that’s supported with good data.</p>
<p>But did you know that a CMA can also be a powerful marketing tool?</p>
<p><strong>For example, consider sending prospects a CMA as part of your <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/real-estate-direct-mail/">direct mail marketing</a> strategy.</strong> Homeowners are rarely in touch with local market trends, despite what they might think. Few could tell you the current value of their home, and chances are, they’d be shocked to know how much the homes in their neighborhoods are currently selling for.</p>
<p>Leveraging a real estate CMA (even a lightweight CMA in a postcard, brochure-style pamphlet, or an email) can help prospects think more seriously about taking the next step. It could be that simply presenting that kind of information to a prospect – at a time when no other agent would – is all it takes to turn them into a lead, and eventually into a client.</p>
<p>By the way, <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/products/professional-for-agents/">you can easily create useful mini CMAs for your leads and clients with Market Leader Pro</a>.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">How To Do a CMA (for Sellers)</h2>
<p>First, a caveat. There’s no such thing as a one-size-fits-all process for making a CMA in real estate. The exact procedures will differ each time, depending on where you are, who it’s for, and why you’re doing it.</p>
<p>So while the four-step process outlined below is a kind of “how-to guide,” it can’t possibly take every situation into account. Too many factors and variables are involved, because all prospects, leads, clients, neighborhoods, homes, and listings are different.</p>
<p>For example, how you do a CMA for a standard ranch-style home in rural America is going to look very different than what you’d do for a inner-city luxury property in Toronto. And the process you’d go through to create a generalized direct mail piece will look different than it would if you were putting a report together for a buyer.</p>
<p>Regardless, it’s helpful to familiarize yourself with the basic methodology that this step-by-step guide outlines so you can tailor it to the needs at hand.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">The Checklist</h3>
<p>Every standard CMA in real estate (for a seller) will include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Property details (Step 1)</li>
<li>Comps (Step 2)</li>
<li>Pricing recommendations (Step 3)</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Step 1: Learn About the Home</h3>
<p>In the steps that follow, you’re going to find comparable listings (or “comps”). To do that, you first need to learn everything you can about the home so you’ll know how to draw accurate comparisons.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that you’re doing more than just fact-collecting. You’re also learning about the home’s “story,” so to speak: the history of the home, the neighborhood, and the surrounding area.</p>
<p>The more research you do here, the more accurate the CMA will be. But here are the essential pieces of information you’ll need to collect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Location</li>
<li>Size (square footage)</li>
<li>Year built</li>
<li>Number of beds and baths</li>
<li>Condition (e.g., Is it new-build? Have there been any significant renovations?)</li>
<li>Amenities, customizations, and special features</li>
<li>Property tax information</li>
</ul>
<p>You can draw from many different sources as you conduct your research, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The homeowner, of course</li>
<li>MLS data</li>
<li>Previous listing data (i.e., list price, sold price, days on the market, etc.)</li>
<li>The NAR’s <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/realtors-property-resource-rpr">Realtors Property Resource</a> (RPR)</li>
<li>Tax records</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Step 2: Compile a List of Comps</h3>
<p>Now that you know about the home, you know how to compare it to other homes in the area. Here are some best practices.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be smart about how you choose your comps.</strong> Comparables (i.e., “comps”) are listings (both sold and active) that are very similar to the property you’re working with. Get as close as you can to finding identical matches, especially in terms of their location, square footage, lot size, layout, style, and condition.</li>
<li><strong>Compile a strong list.</strong> Include enough properties on your list to determine an average and suggest a reasonable range of prices. But don’t make it so long that you and your client get bogged down with too much information.</li>
<li><strong>Stick with the here-and-now.</strong> Remember, the key to making a successful CMA in real estate is to work with accurate, reliable, and relevant data. There’s no point in comparing the home in question to a listing that sold three years ago, or even one year ago, for that matter. You and your client need to know what similar homes are selling for now. So stay current, within, say, the past three months. And in this market, you definitely shouldn’t dig back farther than six months.</li>
<li><strong>Look at sold prices and active listings.</strong> By looking at homes that have sold recently and listings that are currently active, you’ll get an even keener sense of the local market’s condition. Be sure to pay close attention to comparable listings that are currently under contract because that will give you insight into the difference between asking price and sold price. It’s those kinds of nuances that will both impress your clients and give you the competitive edge you need to become the local expert.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Step 3: Set Your Pricing Recommendations</h3>
<p>At this point you’ll be equipped with all of the information you need to provide sound guidance for your clients.</p>
<p>Give them a range of three numbers to consider – one that’s on the conservative side, one that’s on the aggressive side, and one that’s in the middle.</p>
<p>Base your pricing recommendations on three factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your list of comps</li>
<li>The home’s condition and appeal (including any adjustments that need to be made to account for customizations, amenities, renovations, etc.)</li>
<li>Anticipation of where the market seems to be headed</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Step 4: Create and Deliver Your CMA</h3>
<p>There are many formatting options and ways you could present your CMA report to your clients. For you, that might look like a PowerPoint presentation, a simple set of tables and charts, or even a quick email with a bulleted outline.</p>
<p>There’s no right or wrong here. But as we saw in the checklist above, be sure to include at least a summary of the property details, your list of comps, and your pricing recommendations. Make it easy for them to understand your process and how you arrived at your conclusions. Not only does this show the objectivity of your report, but it also puts your leads and clients at ease in case they’re disappointed by numbers they didn’t expect.</p>
<p>However you go about delivering and presenting your CMA, keep in mind that you’re bringing value, proving your worth, and demonstrating your expertise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pictures can say a thousand words, but they can’t say everything. At some point, the power of language has to take over.</p>
<p><strong>The best real estate listing description examples you can find will all have one thing in common: they’ll all have compelling marketing copy that was crafted to <em>sell</em>, not just describe.</strong></p>
<p>If you’ve been overlooking the sales power of copy in your listing descriptions, welcome. You’re not the only one. Mediocre (if not flat out poor) descriptions are the norm. And that’s unfortunate. Because listing descriptions are extremely important.</p>
<p>Consumers are now more likely to search online for a home than ever before. According to a recent report from <a href="https://cdn.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/2022-home-buyers-and-sellers-generational-trends-03-23-2022.pdf">NAR</a>, “Among all generations of home buyers, the first step taken in the home search process was to look online for properties.”</p>
<p>Half of all buyers they surveyed (51%) said they found the home they purchased online. (Which is almost double the amount of those who said they found their home through their agent, by the way.)</p>
<p><strong>The point is, real estate listing descriptions matter. They may even matter a lot, especially if they’re done well.</strong></p>
<p>And the best part is, it’s not as if you have to spend a ton of time mastering the art and science of copywriting. All it takes to boost the selling power of your listing descriptions is a bit of know-how and some practice.</p>
<p>This article will walk you through exactly how to write descriptions that sell (and how not to write them). Then we’ll take a look at four real estate listing description examples from top-notch agents so you can see how it’s done.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">How To Write a Real Estate Listing Description</h2>
<p>Here are some best practices to keep in mind as you supercharge your listings with compelling marketing copy.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Start With the Seller</h3>
<p>As the agent, you can put pieces together and come up with some ideas about what you should highlight in the description. But the seller has a unique perspective on the home, and they know better than you do what it’s like to live there day to day. They’ll almost certainly raise excellent selling points that never would have occurred to you unless you had asked.</p>
<p>Find out what it was that originally caught their attention when they bought. What do they love about it? What will they miss when they sell?</p>
<p>Their favorite things about the home are likely to be the same things that will attract potential buyers. So before you work your marketing magic, get inspiration straight from the sellers themselves.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Write to Your Audience</h3>
<p>In other words, don’t write listing descriptions that only sound good to you and your client. Let it all revolve around potential buyers (and their agent).</p>
<p>Listing agents are, above all else, marketers. And marketers always determine a target buyer for their products before coming up with a plan.</p>
<p>We don’t see urban streetwear companies appealing to Gen X or Baby Boomers. Millennials aren’t likely to get targeted online ads from AARP. Yet the average listing description is a lot like the average real estate agent – trying to be all things to all people. That has never worked before, and it won’t work for you.</p>
<p>So before you write a word, put yourself in your prospects’ shoes. What will they want to hear? What are the kinds of things they’ll be looking for? Write their dream home into your copy.</p>
<p>What objections or fears might they have? Cut them off at the pass and address concerns head-on. Do they think it’s unaffordable? Talk about how easy financing can be.</p>
<p>Is it a family home with a large backyard and schools nearby? Speak directly to the parents. Is it a swanky uptown condo that looks like a status symbol? Speak to that millionaire entrepreneur looking for a home that doubles as an accessory.</p>
<p>Your listing descriptions need a personal flair that cater to the home buyers you’re trying to reach. Play into their vision, and make it clear that your listing is exactly what they’re looking for.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Craft a Killer Headline</h3>
<p>The amazing listing description you labored to create is worthless if no one reads it. And the best way to get potential buyers to read your description is to write a headline they can’t ignore, a headline that captures their attention and sets the tone for the entire listing.</p>
<p>The main purpose of the headline is to get them to read the first line of your description. And the main purpose of that first line is to get them to read your second line, and on and on it goes.</p>
<p>If you spent as much time crafting the headline as you did writing the description, it would be time well spent.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Think Like a Copywriter</h3>
<p>When you’re writing real estate listing descriptions, you’re writing to sell. At its core, what you’re doing here is no different than what legendary advertising experts like <a href="https://www.oneclub.org/hall-of-fame/-bio/david-ogilvy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">David Ogilvy</a> did for decades.</p>
<p>So don’t approach this task as a real estate agent filling in the blank on a form that says “Description”. Approach it as if you were Mad Men’s Don Draper penning irresistible marketing copy that turns heads and closes deals.</p>
<p>To make your “adman” impersonation believable, here are some quick-and-dirty tips for writing like a copywriter.</p>
<ul class="BlogUL">
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Lead with the benefits.</strong> Then move to the features. In other words, talk first about how the home will benefit the buyer, what problems it may solve for them, and why all of that matters. Then get into the specs and nitty-gritty details.</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Write like a human.</strong> Studies have proven over and over that simple, person-to-person writing is most effective. So say what you mean and keep it conversational. Read it out loud to test yourself – if it sounds like normal human speech, you’re on the right track!</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Be concise.</strong> Less is (often) more when it comes to writing marketing copy. Use powerful words that pack a punch instead of frivolous adverbs.</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Create a sense of urgency.</strong> Buyers know homes don’t stay on the market for long. Give them that extra nudge they need to take action now by <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/create-sense-of-urgency-in-prospect-roleplay">creating a sense of urgency</a>.</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>“Show, don’t tell.”</strong> Guide their daydreaming and create mental images. Why list the dimensions of the kitchen when you could say, “You can cook for 2 or 20 in this spacious, guest-friendly kitchen.” Instead of stating flatly that the ceilings are made of plaster, mention that they could “entertain beneath soaring Venetian plaster ceilings.”</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Don’t Do This When You Write Listing Descriptions</h2>
<p>Now you know how to write real estate listing descriptions. But here’s what not to do.</p>
<ul class="BlogUL">
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Don’t overthink it.</strong> Yes, your listing descriptions are important. But the stakes aren’t so high that you need to spend hours and hours crafting a perfect piece. Why? First, because it’ll take you way too long to write. And also because your writing will show that you overthought it, which will make it less effective.</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Don’t use clever or flowery language.</strong> Write plainly. This isn’t a novel. The words themselves shouldn’t steal the spotlight. Yes, think creatively, but don’t distract the prospect with pretty prose. It’s counterproductive and misses the point completely.</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Don’t repeat information.</strong> Space is valuable. Don’t waste it by repeating all of the details that show up in the listing details. Describe the property in a way that doesn’t tell them what they already know (e.g., lot size, year built, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>There are more blunders to avoid. <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/5-cringe-worthy-mistakes-experienced-agents-make-on-their-listings/">Learn about the five cringe-worthy mistakes experienced agents make on their listings.</a></p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">4 Creative Real Estate Listing Description Examples</h2>
<p>Glean wisdom from these four noteworthy listing description examples from expert real estate agents and let the inspiration begin.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">1. Evoke Settings &amp; Scenes</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-61763 " src="https://www.marketleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Cathedral.png" alt="Real estate listing description example #1" width="443" height="760" /></p>
<p>This first listing description example does a great job of using language to create mental images. For example, we imagine waking up in the loft suite, hosting a big party out on the deck, and huddling around the fire pit. Framing your listing descriptions in this way gets your prospects to “read between the lines” and see in their mind’s eye more than what appears in the copy. (Plus, this listing gets extra credit for ending with that perfect call to action!)</p>
<p>Well done, <a href="https://www.eastsidepropertysearch.com/listing/mlsid/185/propertyid/1997697/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aubie Pouncey</a>!</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">2. Pile Up All the Perks</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-61764" src="https://www.marketleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lynnwood.png" alt="Real estate listing description example #2" width="443" height="763" /></p>
<p>Notice how this listing description example heaps on the goodness. Just when you think it couldn’t get any better, it does. We learn immediately that it’s “better than new” in that fantastic opening line. As we read on, we hear about upgrade after upgrade, with the excitement-building repetition of the word “new”. By the end, it sets the prospect up to feel like the decision to make a move on this house is a no-brainer. Numerous renovations, great floor plan, “dramatic two story entry,” private yard, fantastic location… What more could you want!?</p>
<p>Thanks for showing us how it’s done, <a href="https://www.elizabethavery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elizabeth Avery</a>!</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">3. Show Authentic Enthusiasm</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-61765" src="https://www.marketleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bramble.png" alt="Real estate listing description example #3" width="443" height="761" /></p>
<p>The excitement is palpable. And yet, it doesn’t come across as contrived or cheesy. This home’s apparent uniqueness speaks for itself, and the copy in this third listing description example does a great job of emphasizing that fact. It leaves the reader feeling as if they just have to see it to believe it. It’s hard not to feel joyful when you read things like, “this home is nothing short of AMAZING,” and, “This location is one you just can’t recreate!” And as a side note, who doesn’t want to work with an agent with that kind of contagious energy!?</p>
<p>We can feel your beachside happiness all the way from here, <a href="https://www.peggyrowerealty.com/listing/mlsid/297/propertyid/900674/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peggy Rowe</a>!</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">4. Speak to the Heart of Your Audience With Laser-like Focus</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-61766 aligncenter" src="https://www.marketleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Scottsdale.png" alt="Real estate listing descriptions example #4" width="443" height="735" /></p>
<p>This final home listing description example demonstrates why it’s so important to understand your audience. If you have a thorough understanding of who your potential buyers are, what they care about, and what their pain points are, you’ll know exactly how to capture their hearts with your listing description. This example has a very clear target (buyers interested in downsizing; buyers who have prioritized convenience and simplicity; buyers looking for a vacation home, seasonal home, or a home they can feel comfortable leaving behind when they travel). And the entire listing description is centered on meeting their needs and addressing their concerns.</p>
<p>Thank you, <a href="https://www.pollyblackwell.com/listing/mlsid/8/propertyid/6477055/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polly Blackwell</a>! You nailed it.</p>

<p>Still not sure if you’re ready to take the first step? That’s okay. To give you an idea of what to expect, here’s a sketch of some of the concepts covered in the full guide.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">What Is a Real Estate Marketing Plan?</h2>
<p>A real estate marketing plan is an organized collection of strategies, systems, and schedules that individual agents, teams, and brokerages use to guide their marketing efforts.</p>
<p>Every marketing plan for real estate must incorporate the five essential components listed below.</p>
<p>Which (if any) do you already have in place?</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">A Brand Structure</h3>
<p>If you have a weak brand, you’re more likely to lose focus, disappear in the crowd of competition, and misrepresent who you are as an agent. All of which reduces productivity and hinders your ability to acquire and retain quality leads.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH3">Data &amp; Analytics</h2>
<p>When you’re armed with statistics, analytics, and insights, you’re better able to set goals, track progress, and make your success repeatable. Without data, your marketing efforts are more likely to be a complete gamble, if not a guessing game.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">An Understanding of Consumers’ New Expectations</h3>
<p>Service providers of all kinds are constantly adjusting the way they do business to keep up with changes in technology, tactics, and trends. Are you aware of what prospects and clients expect of you as a real estate agent? If not, you risk falling to the background.</p>
<p>For example, most of today’s consumers expect prompt communication via text message. In a <a href="https://cdn.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/2022-home-buyers-and-sellers-generational-trends-03-23-2022.pdf">2022 report from the National Association of Realtors</a> (NAR), 71% of buyers said it was “important” to receive property information and communication from their agent via text message. Whereas in <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/reports/2015/2015-home-buyer-and-seller-generational-trends-2015-03-11.pdf">2015</a> – just seven years earlier – that figure was only 45%.</p>
<p>Consumers expectations change fast, and you need to keep up.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Social Proof</h3>
<p>Speaking of what consumers want, near the top of the list is authentic proof of your competency, especially in the form of reviews and testimonials. In what ways could you add social proof to your marketing efforts? Common ways for agents include requesting reviews on their Facebook pages or Zillow profiles.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Technology &amp; Tools</h3>
<p>The best real estate marketing plans include a social media strategy, video content, <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/solutions/marketing-automation/">robust marketing automation tools</a>, a <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/solutions/customizable-websites/">customizable real estate website</a>, and a <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/solutions/crm/">fully-integrated CRM</a>. But of course, merely having the right tools won’t be enough. You have to know how to use them.</p>
<p>Learn how. <a style="font-weight: 800;" href="#download">Download our free “2023 Real Estate Marketing Plan”</a> and make today the day you begin taking your business to the next level.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Only SMART Goals Will Produce the Results You Want</h2>
<p>Goal-setting is a crucial part of marketing for real estate agents. And maybe you’ve already established goals, but you’re not seeing the results you want.</p>
<p>The reason may be that they’re not SMART goals: smart, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound.</p>
<p>This approach enables you to set realistic goals while also increasing the likelihood that you’ll actually achieve them.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">3 Examples of SMART Goals</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>“I will increase the average number of leads I generate every month by 20 percent by the end of 2023.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I will attend one webinar or download one guide about lead generation best practices every month throughout 2023.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I will 1) research which real estate website provider has the best websites for generating leads and 2) implement a new website from that provider by the end of the first quarter.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Want a full breakdown of each part of the acronym so you can start setting results-producing goals today? <a style="font-weight: 800;" href="#download">Get our free interactive marketing planning guide.</a></p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">5 Must-Have Real Estate Marketing Strategies</h2>
<p>Goals are worthless if you don’t have specific strategies in place to help you reach them. Think of them as the difference between planning and wishful thinking. They are the “how” to your “what.”</p>
<p>It would be impossible to list <em>all</em> of the many strategies you could implement as part of your marketing plan. Plus, it wouldn’t be very helpful for you to skim through a dizzying array of possibilities. Instead, let’s narrow it down to five real estate marketing ideas that are sure to generate more leads.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Invest in Advertising</h3>
<p>In the <a style="font-weight: 800;" href="#download">“2023 Real Estate Marketing Plan,”</a> not only will you get practical pro tips for advertising, but you’ll also get a customizable budgeting calendar so you can put money where your <em>month</em> is.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Develop a Strategy for Referrals</h3>
<p>Imagine if every one of your former clients referred someone to you every year. That’s totally conceivable, and the success would be compounding – and life-changing! The guide gives you three ideas to jumpstart your referral strategy brainstorming session.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Use Marketing Automation Tools</h3>
<p>The best marketing automation tools do it all. With <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/products/professional-for-agents/">Market Leader Professional</a>, for example, you get a customizable, lead-generating website; a fully-integrated CRM; and the ability to automate new listing alerts, newsletters, and print and digital content pieces like postcards, flyers, and video-enabled mobile-responsive emails.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Leverage the Power of Social Media</h3>
<p>To give you a shortcut for implementing an efficient and productive social media strategy, the <a style="font-weight: 800;" href="#download">“2023 Real Estate Marketing Plan”</a> provides a handy “Social Media Cheat Sheet” so you’ll know the audience, tone, and user intentions applicable for each channel.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Get Exclusive Buyer &amp; Seller Leads Delivered to You Each Month</h3>
<p>Securing a steady stream of exclusive online leads each month cuts down on the time you have to spend on prospecting, while also putting you in a better position to plan for the future. For example, Market Leader offers <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/products/real-estate-leads/">real estate leads</a> which will empower you to reach your sales goals and sidestep the stressful boom-and-bust cycle.</p>
<h2 id="download" class="BlogH2">What Else Is Included in the Guide?</h2>
<p>In addition to all that we alluded to above, the “2023 Real Estate Marketing Plan” also provides the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information about how to build your brand, including your unique value proposition, mission statement, vision statement, and target audience</li>
<li>The “Marketing Audit” worksheet</li>
<li>The “SWOT Analysis” worksheet</li>
<li>The “Digital Marketing Toolkit”</li>
<li>And most importantly, the “Create Your Marketing Plan” worksheet where you can pull it all together to craft a comprehensive, actionable, results-oriented plan of your own to generate more leads than ever before</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re writing real estate newsletters only because that’s what your competition is doing, then you’re doing it for the wrong reason. Your newsletter should support your overall marketing strategy. If it doesn’t, you could be wasting time, money, and energy.</p>
<p>That might seem like a daunting task at first. But don’t worry. With these five fail-safe marketing tips and five ideas for newsletter content, you’ll have all you need to create effective, compelling, and engaging newsletters.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">1. Identify Your Target Audience</h2>
<p>This is the most important step. And yet it’s the step that gets overlooked most often.</p>
<p>You can’t nail the bullseye if you don’t know where the target is. So before you do anything, think through <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/creating-a-target-market-for-your-real-estate-business/">the target market for your newsletters</a>. Then establish goals. What do you want your newsletters to accomplish as they relate to your overall marketing strategy?</p>
<p>It might be tempting to think you’re marketing to “everyone.” But real estate marketing strategies like that tend to be unfruitful. It’s been said many times, but it bears repeating: if you try to be all things to all people, you run the risk of not being anything to anyone.</p>
<p>Who are you trying to stay in contact with? Who are you trying to sell homes to? Are they retirees? First-time homebuyers? People purchasing investment properties? The more specific you can get, the better.</p>
<p>Depending on where you are on your journey as a real estate agent, this step might take some time. But developing a <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/the-7-essentials-of-real-estate-marketing-plans/">solid real estate marketing strategy</a> is always worth it.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">2. Tailor Your Newsletter to Your Target Audience’s Needs</h2>
<p>Don’t make the mistake of talking about yourself all the time. “I just sold this amazing house.” “Here’s why I’m the number one agent in the city.”</p>
<p>Of course, there’s nothing wrong with a little self-promotion here and there. But if it ever comes close to appearing that you are all you care about, you’ve gone too far.</p>
<p>Your readers probably already know how great you are. That may be why they subscribed to your newsletter to begin with! Ultimately, what they’re after is the benefit. They want to know what’s in it for them.</p>
<p>So gear all of your content (even your own promotional plugs) toward your reader and how they can benefit. Make it a habit to ask yourself these two questions as you craft your newsletter: “So what? Who cares?” Each section of every newsletter you send should provide answers to those questions.</p>
<p>Let’s get even more specific. Be sure to tailor your content according to the type of lead with whom you’re communicating. There&#8217;s no better way to get people to tune you out than to send them content that doesn&#8217;t relate to their needs. Have you taken steps to ensure your seller leads are only receiving content relevant for people considering selling their homes? What about for buyers?</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">3. Choose the Format</h2>
<p>Decide if you want a <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/make-print-marketing-part-of-your-strategy/">print</a> or <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/the-real-estate-guide-to-email-marketing-and-automation/">email</a> newsletter. (Or both!)</p>
<p>While print newsletters might cost more than emailing, they continue to perform well year after year. With <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/solutions/marketing-automation/">the right marketing tool</a>, they’re easier to create and print than you might think. Everything from designing to printing to shipping your print newsletters can be taken care of in a single system like Market Leader Professional.</p>
<p>Print newsletters can be just as effective as email newsletters (if not more so). Why? One of the main reasons is that the reach of direct mail tends to be more focused. It has less to compete with than email.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.usps.com/business/promotions/direct-mail-brochure.pdf">one report</a> indicated that the average person receives over 150 emails per day, whereas the average household receives only about two pieces of mail per day. Plus, print newsletters have staying power: they can easily be passed on, left in waiting rooms, or handed out in person. The con? Direct mail is less of a trackable medium than email, limiting your ability to monitor and track progress.</p>
<p>Email newsletters one the other hand are less expensive and even easier to create. And emails make it much easier for you to collect all of the data you want, monitor success, and iterate your strategy. But if you’re not careful, they can look like spam or get lost in the sea of other emails your prospects get on any given day.</p>
<p>Can’t decide? Go back to your overall marketing strategy. If your target audience consists of retirees, for example, a printed newsletter might best. If you’re aiming for relatively young first-time buyers, maybe it’s best to go the email route.</p>
<p>And remember, there isn’t necessarily a right or wrong answer. It’s about what works best for your particular audience.</p>
<p>You may even choose to do both. Reaching out to people with two mediums increases the likelihood that you connect with them. If you call someone every day at 1 p.m. and they don’t pick up, you should try calling at a different time. The same concept applies to newsletters: If you can’t connect with email, print might work.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">4. Pack Your Newsletter With Engaging Content</h2>
<p>Whether you go with print or email, it’s always important to stand out. Your number one newsletter content priority is to keep your reader engaged. Here are some general guidelines worth following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay special attention to the design elements and make it look appealing.<br />
Make it interesting and easy to read.</li>
<li>Be concise.</li>
<li>Provide relevant information about buying and selling and other related topics.</li>
<li>Provide research and insight with useful, compelling, and actionable data.</li>
<li>Include calls to action.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, make it valuable.</p>
<p>Personalizing your newsletter will make it stand out from the crowd. So write about topics that are interesting to you or that your target market will find informative. You are trying to connect with your audience, and there’s nothing that will lose that connection faster than a boring newsletter.</p>
<p>Need some inspiration on content themes for your real estate newsletters? Here are five ideas to jumpstart your imagination.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Idea #1: Inform</h3>
<ul>
<li>Customize your newsletter for each prospect. If you know where your prospect is searching, talk about interesting things happening in that area: new shopping centers opening up, schools that performed highly on state exams, local bars and restaurants with great reviews, etc. If you have too many prospects to manage something like this, customize your content according to your top five prospects’ personalities and interests.</li>
<li>Keep your prospects up to date with trends in interest rates, home values, and neighborhood stats.</li>
<li>Most consumers will be interested in listings. Take a few listings that are extremely interesting (customized to the prospect) and post them on your newsletter with a link back to your website. This keeps them engaged with you and off unrelated websites where they&#8217;ll run into other agents vying for their attention.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Idea #2: Offer Discounts to Local Businesses</h3>
<ul>
<li>This is a great way to add tangible value to your newsletter. But more than that, it shows that you have a variety of local connections, which can go a long way to boost your credibility as a real estate agent.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Idea #3: Make It Warm &amp; Relational</h3>
<ul>
<li>Express your personality (while always keeping it professional, of course).</li>
<li>Share pictures and personal updates.</li>
<li>Sure this is a nice idea. But it’s more than that. Adding a small relational component to your newsletter shows that you’re not just a sales shark hunting for your next closing.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Idea #4: Provide Helpful Advice</h3>
<ul>
<li>Position yourself as <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/3-tactics-to-position-yourself-as-the-neighborhood-expert/">the local expert</a>.</li>
<li>Do the work of analysis for them. Numbers, charts, and infographics are great, but always be sure to help your readers understand the data. Offer suggestions and draw conclusions.</li>
<li>Want to take your marketing strategy to the next level? Write a blog where you can share your expert opinion on trending topics in real estate and link your newsletter to it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Idea #5: Make It Fun</h3>
<ul>
<li>Include games, puzzles, amusing articles, contests, recipes, or funny cartoons and videos.</li>
<li>But remember: adding a touch of entertainment to an otherwise boring newsletter isn’t “just for fun.” If it’s done well, it can be extremely useful in helping you establish a connection with your leads.</li>
</ul>
<p>First we considered the importance of developing a real estate marketing strategy, establishing your target audience, and tailoring your newsletter to fit your readers’ needs. Then we saw five of the best newsletter ideas that will jumpstart your content creation journey. That’s a great foundation.</p>
<p>But if you’re looking for the best way to maximize efficiency and elevate your CRM toolkit as a real estate agent, you won’t want to miss this fifth and final marketing tip.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">5. Use a Marketing Automation Tool</h2>
<p>The best <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/real-estate-marketing-automation/">real estate marketing automation tools</a> allow you to save time and energy on marketing to your contact database, which in turn frees you up to serve your clients.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/products/professional-for-agents/">Market Leader Professional</a>, for example, you’ll be able to create (and automate) effective newsletters that bring value to both you and your contacts. Plus, you’ll get a customizable website, a fully-integrated CRM, and all of the marketing automation you’ll need to take your business to the next level.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today’s ever-changing digital world necessitates the use of technology to manage and maximize your relationships, transactions, and successfully market your business as well as your listings. With <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/2021-home-buyers-and-sellers-generational-trends-03-16-2021.pdf">97% of homebuyers searching online</a>, your digital presence is not only important, it&#8217;s necessary to provide the real estate experience consumers expect today. As consumer expectations rise and attention spans become shorter, real estate marketing automation guarantees that no lead goes untouched and keeps you top-of-mind throughout the entire home buying and selling journeys.</p>
<p>Marketing automation saves the time and energy it would take to perform marketing tasks manually by automating the creation, scheduling, and sending of marketing campaigns. Real estate marketing automation streamlines lead generation and management, email marketing, the creation of single property websites, listing marketing, and social media marketing, so agents can focus on spending more time in front of their clients.</p>
<p>Having a CRM that supports your business is key. We recommend a platform that tracks lead behavior and automatically updates your contact database with new leads as they come into your funnel – whether they’re coming from your website, from third party sources like social media, or referrals.</p>
<p>Most CRMs come with the ability to automate repetitive tasks and marketing communications, like sending a follow up email to a new lead with listings they just saved on your website. Automation can do a lot of heavy lifting for you, when done correctly.</p>
<p>Your real estate CRM should track your lead’s activity on your website and help you engage with them accordingly by sending them automated listing alerts from your MLS, letting you know when they are active on your website so you can strike while the iron is hot, and with drip campaigns that provide consistent and relevant information to help them through their real estate journey.</p>
<p>An intuitive CRM that can monitor your lead’s activity is going to put you in the position to speak directly to their interests and activities in a way that’s neither invasive or creepy. In today’s digital world, customers are targeted by technology that tracks their online activity, allowing you to speak to them, wherever they are in their customer journey. Once you know what your leads are searching for and interested in, you can cultivate personalized messaging to engage them, build trust, and earn their business.</p>
<p>“The right CRM will have real estate marketing automation and go to work for you, helping you manage and nurture relationships who aren’t quite ready to transact, so you can focus on spending more time in front of clients. Having a CRM that truly supports your business is key,” says Brandy Savage, Market Leader Success Coach.</p>
<p>A CRM’s ability to automate marketing tasks saves time and energy, allowing agents to focus more time on relationship building.</p>
<p><strong>Market Leader Professional&#8217;s real estate marketing automation includes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>creating and sending marketing campaigns based on lead type (buyers, sellers, referrals, relocations, and more)</li>
<li>streamlining lead generation and management by integrating with dozens of lead sources</li>
<li>email marketing with drip campaigns that keep you top-of-mind</li>
<li>creating single property websites</li>
<li>automated <a href="/blog/real-estate-marketing-automation-for-listing-agents/">listing marketing</a></li>
<li>social media marketing</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><strong>Pro Tip: </strong>Technology is only as good as its users. If you invest in technology, always be sure to go through training for your software solutions and become familiar with best practices when it comes to digital communications on the channels you use.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Know when to take your communication offline.</strong></p>
<p>This is a big one. CRMs and marketing platforms are great for managing relationships and tracking activity, but should never take the place of real-life interaction. Knowing when to pick up the phone or meet in person is vital. While having a system to automate manual tasks, connect multiple lead sources, and nurture your contacts is crucial for successful relationship management, knowing when to take your communications offline is critical to actually converting leads. Never underestimate the value of human interaction.</p>
<p>The best way to connect with your leads is to meet them offline <em>when they’re ready.</em> If they start to ask questions about listings, your expertise or for advice, pick up the phone and suggest meeting face-to-face.</p>
<p>Market Leader Professional comes fully equipped with MLS integrations, a marketing suite with thousands of professionally designed marketing pieces and automation that enables you to continuously engage your sphere across multiple channels.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What&#8217;s it take to be a successful real estate agent in 2021? Real estate leads and a plan.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s be honest here. You can be a people person, a strong closer, and an awesome negotiator, but none of those skills even come into play unless you’re generating leads. A steady stream of leads is crucial to your success.</p>
<p>Googling &#8220;real estate agent failure rates&#8221; will yield multiple results that agree that as many as 87% of real estate agents fail in their first five years in the business. Look around when you&#8217;re around new agents and know that only one in seven of them will be in the business in five years. Beating the odds with a constant flow of quality leads is your key to success.</p>
<h2>Building your real estate leads pipeline</h2>
<p>Real estate agents often enter the business without a healthy understanding of what it takes to build a pipeline and be successful in the business. If you are doing everything and doing it right, at the minimum you will need:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A branded website </strong><strong>–</strong> In 2021, an online presence is central to establish your business and brand— i.e., lend credibility.</li>
<li><strong>CRM with marketing and automation –</strong> You need a CRM system to store, manage and market your database. As a relationship business, you need a relationship manager developed specifically for the real estate industry. The nuances of real estate are critically important as you&#8217;re building your pipeline.</li>
<li><strong>IDX on your website – </strong>Your website will need an IDX search feature to attract and engage buyers and sellers. Without IDX, your website will not rank with search engines and consumers searching online will not be able to search properties. IDX technology is the number one engagement tool a real estate agent can have in their arsenal.</li>
<li><strong>Social media marketing – </strong>Many potential buyers and sellers spend far more time on social media than they do searching on the Internet. You need to reach them where they are. Here are some ways to <a href="/blog/social-media-to-generate-leads/">generate leads on social platforms</a>.</li>
<li><strong>A SOI for referrals – </strong>You should have a system to automatically reach out regularly and keep your name top-of-mind with people in your SOI, or Sphere of Influence. Do not make the mistake of overestimating the number of friends and family members that you think will buy or sell a home with you. In the U.S. on average people only move every 8 years, so it can take a while to realize business from your SOI. Your sphere is valuable, but it takes time and long term nurturing.</li>
<li><strong>Advertising – </strong>SEO has become so competitive that few real estate websites make it to the first page in search engines. Using pay-per-click advertising, you can buy that click with first page ads and direct people to your website that are searching with key phrases you set up.</li>
<li><strong>Leads – </strong>The crux of a successful agent. Every agent needs leads, but building a healthy sphere or referral business takes a lot of time and energy. Many successful agents opt to purchase <a href="/products/real-estate-leads">leads</a>. Lead generation is a numbers game and the more leads you’re generating, the better the odds of hitting your goals. Not all leads are created equal, however. It’s important to make sure the leads you’re purchasing are exclusive to you and in your target areas.</li>
</ul>
<p>Working from multiple systems can be a huge challenge and can be quite expensive. There is a cost for the website, hosting, IDX fees, PPC, marketing, etc. Monthly fees can add up fast.</p>
<h2>Just how many leads will you need to hit your goals?</h2>
<p>You can’t build and manage a lead generation strategy until you know how many leads you need. To start that process you must determine your desired income. Then your average expected commission and using your conversion or closing percentage of the real estate leads you generate; you can determine how many you need.</p>
<p><u><a href="https://www.marketleader.com/leadcalculator/">This calculator does the trick</a></u>. You can experiment with the numbers and come up with the exact number of leads you need to reach your goals.</p>
<h2>Tried-and-true ways to generate real estate leads:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hold open houses for your brokerage –  </strong>Nothing might sound more daunting, but there it is a great way to get in front of new faces and start building your business. Especially if you are in a hot market.</li>
<li><strong>Cold calling </strong><strong>–  </strong> Thousands of agents across the country fill their pipelines – and their bank accounts – by picking up the phone every morning and <a href="/blog/cold-calling-best-practices/">dialing for dollars</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Door knocking –</strong> Another dreadful lead generation term, but doors were built to be opened. Not every door will open and convert, but it&#8217;s a great way to get in front of people. As the pandemic begins to ease up and more of the population gets vaccinated, there&#8217;s a good chance no one has knocked on your farms door in a while. Opportunistic agents can take advantage. Of course, wear a mask and never assume others have the same comfort level as you do.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Is there a TURNKEY solution that brings it all together?</h2>
<p>Another drawback of piecemealed systems is that you spend too many resources managing them. Time, money, energy, <em>time</em>. You work too hard and long to generate leads and manage them from multiple systems, not to mention the costs often associated with each.</p>
<p>Market Leader Professional comes with a infinitely customizable website that captures buyer and seller leads and tracks the properties they view, the time on your site, and more, then delivers those insights directly to you in real time. All lead insights are also populated in your CRM for follow-up marketing and relationship-building.</p>
<p>When a lead is captured, you want to follow up with other marketing, from phone calls to print to email. You want a CRM to take the site information and help you follow up.</p>
<p>An effective <u><a href="/products/professional-for-agents/">real estate turnkey solution like this one</a></u> will give you these crucial features:</p>
<ul>
<li>A customizable website designed generate real estate leads.</li>
<li>Insights to help you track lead behavior and follow-up.</li>
<li>An integrated CRM with marketing automation</li>
<li>An all-inclusive monthly cost that is affordable and delivers the real estate leads you need to build a healthy pipeline and successful business, for years to come.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can be the world&#8217;s strongest closer, a great people person, and a relationship builder, but you could be history in less than five years unless you employ a comprehensive strategy to generate and convert real estate leads.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You know all that stuff you want potential clients to know about you? How easy you are to work with, how experienced and knowledgeable you are and how you saved a particular transaction?</p>
<p>You can, as many agents do, create a space on your website to list all of that. But most of these pieces come off as far too salesy and way too much like what every other agent in town says about themselves.</p>
<p>And, it’s not just real estate agent marketing that creates skepticism in consumers – today, any claims by any company that aren’t backed up by consumer reviews are treated with suspicion.</p>
<h2><strong>If you aren’t collecting agent reviews – aka testimonials &#8212; from your clients, you should start</strong></h2>
<p>More than 85 percent of consumers check a local business’ reviews online, according to the Local Consumer Review Survey 2018 from <a href="https://www.brightlocal.com/research/local-consumer-review-survey/">BrightLocal.com</a> a firm that offers reputation management services, among others.</p>
<p>And, 27 percent of these consumers looked for a business review online daily, the study claims.</p>
<p>Sadly, more than half of those in the ideal real estate demographic (ages 35 to 54) are more likely to read reviews for restaurants and cafés than real estate agents.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean they don’t check real estate agent reviews, because they do.</p>
<h2><strong>It’s “social proof” and all agents need it</strong></h2>
<p>“ … we determine what is correct by finding out what other people think is correct,” according to psychologist <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/006124189X/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0">Robert Cialdini</a>, who coined the phrase “social proof” in his 2009 book, <em>Influence: Science and Practice.</em></p>
<p>It’s a bit hard to admit that we’re basically sheep, looking to others to find out what is correct, what is “best.” But that’s exactly what we do, especially when we’re feeling uncertain.</p>
<p>“Uncertainty is the fuel that activates and feeds the mechanisms of social proof. When faced with an unfamiliar situation, an unsure individual would feel the need to refer to other people for guidance,” claims an unnamed writer at <a href="https://www.psychologynoteshq.com/social-proof/">PsychologyNotesHQ.com</a>.</p>
<p>In real estate, social proof offers proof of your credibility, removes that uncertainty (thereby instilling trust) and helps consumers get to know you.</p>
<h2><strong>How to choose which testimonials to use in your marketing</strong></h2>
<p>Believe it or not, not all reviews that seem “good” are actually good for your marketing efforts. Thankfully, surveys and studies show us which ones to trash and which to use.</p>
<h3>Regardless of how amazing a review is, don’t use it if any of the following apply:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The review is older than three months. Consumers find these reviews irrelevant.</li>
<li>Reviews that are unsigned or use initials. Zillow or Yelp usernames instead of real names destroys the value of a review. Consumers think they are “fake.” Ask your clients to use their first and last name when they leave a review.</li>
</ul>
<h3>According to the Bright Local survey, consumers place the most value on the number of stars in a rating and then, in order of importance to them:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Quantity of reviews</li>
<li>Recency</li>
<li>Length/detail</li>
<li>Sentiment of the review</li>
<li>Business response or non/response</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>How to use your real estate agent reviews</strong></h2>
<p>Naturally you should have a section of your website devoted to your testimonials, but don’t stop there.</p>
<p>Choose one line from one of your favorite reviews. Ensure it encapsulates exactly why a real estate consumer should choose you above all other agents in your market.</p>
<p>It’s tempting to choose the most flattering-to-your-ego testimonial, but don’t do it. A <a href="https://magazine.realtor/sales-and-marketing/feature/article/2015/03/what-your-online-about-me-says-about-you">REALTOR® Magazine survey</a> of real estate consumers finds that they are “strongly critical of agents who posted testimonials that appeared overly self-serving.”</p>
<p>Instead, choose one that highlights your success in overcoming a typical real estate consumer pain point.</p>
<p>A testimonial that mentioned how the agent sold the home “in 19 days for asking price” was particularly attractive to the panelists in the aforementioned survey.</p>
<p>One panelist said that the days on market mention gave the testimonia credibility, “considering many online agent reviews are less detailed and sound automated.”</p>
<p>Consider this when choosing that one line from a testimonial. If you’re having trouble choosing, ask a non-real estate related friend or family member to read your testimonials and pick out one sentence that would make them want to call you.</p>
<p>Then, use that one-line quote above the fold on your website, in your email signature and wherever else you can plaster it.</p>
<p>Real estate reviews allow consumers to get an idea of what you’re like to work with, how well you negotiate, market and overall perform your job.</p>
<p>They can also help boost your credibility and instill trust.</p>
<p>Whether it’s where to eat dinner on Friday night, which movie to watch or which real estate agent to choose, social proof, in the form of reviews, is one of the most powerful marketing tools around.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/how-to-maximize-the-power-of-real-estate-agent-reviews-testimonials/">How to Maximize the Power of Real Estate Agent Reviews & Testimonials</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>A Simple Guide to Real Estate Yard Signs</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Are your real estate signs working as hard as they should?</strong></h2>
<p>Did you know that there is a “Standard Alphabets for Highway Signs” book? And, who knew that there exists in the U.S. the Foundation for the Advancement of the Sign Industry?</p>
<p>In fact, highway signage has a whole set of rules that we’re willing to wager few of agents consider when sticking for-sale real estate signs in a client’s lawn.</p>
<p>It only makes sense, however, when we <em>do</em> think about it. For the public’s safety, highway signs must be legible from certain distances.</p>
<p>For an entirely different reason, real estate signs also need to be legible from certain distances.</p>
<p>Here we are in 2019, well past the dawn of the digital age, and little has changed with real estate signage. They’re still stuck in the front yard or window of a home for sale, they still get muddy and many agents still make the same mistakes with them.</p>
<p>Of course, any discussion of real estate signage should be prefaced with the caveat that the majority of brokers and franchise owners dictate the use of their branded signs, so many agents don’t have a choice of what is on their real estate signs.</p>
<p>If you do have a choice, read on for information on how to make your real estate signs work hard to bring in buyers and, quite possibly generate additional real estate leads.</p>
<h2><strong>Remember the sign’s true purpose</strong></h2>
<p>One agent in a Facebook group brags that his signs are emblazoned with a very large copy of his logo. He loves the feedback he gets from the public.</p>
<p>“I get calls from people who say things like ‘I can’t turn in this town without seeing your sign.’”</p>
<p>It’s cool to get accolades from others, but the only accolades you should be aiming for with your real estate signs are those from your listing clients to all the folks they’ll be referring to your business.</p>
<p>And that won’t happen if your real estate signs are vanity signs.</p>
<p>Listing clients hire agents to market their homes for sale, not to market themselves. It’s dishonest to use your clients’ front yard to erect a monument to yourself.</p>
<p>A real estate sign’s main job is to clearly and concisely convey the listing agent’s contact information. And you can do so in a number of ways.</p>
<h2><strong>What color is your real estate sign? </strong></h2>
<p>“During the day, our eyes are most easily able to pick up green light, followed by yellow and blue,” according to April Sanders at Sciencing.com.</p>
<p>Red, on the other hand, is the least easy to view from a distance. At night, yellow is most visible.</p>
<p>So, what does this mean for real estate signs? No, we aren’t advocating you change your branding colors to suit your signage, but do consider that the phone number, the most important element of your sign, might look dashing in yellow against a green background.</p>
<h2><strong>Typography</strong></h2>
<p>One rule of thumb in the signage industry is that the individual letters on a real estate sign should measure 1 inch in height for every 30 feet in distance from the viewer.</p>
<p>“Thus, if a sign must be readable from 300 feet, its letters must be at least 10 inches tall,” according to Wade Swormstedt, executive director of the Foundation for the Advancement of the Sign Industry.</p>
<p>Since the widely accepted <a href="https://plannersweb.com/">width of a residential street</a>, from curb-to-curb, is 28 feet, the minimum height of the phone number on your sign should be 10 inches tall. That way, the family passing by on the other side of the street can see it.</p>
<p>For another take on letter height in signage, check out <a href="https://www.signazon.com/help-center/sign-letter-height-visibility-chart.aspx">this signage chart</a>.</p>
<p>It’s interesting how the digital age ushered in an attention to typography. Everyone has a favorite font, right?</p>
<p>The problem is that our favorites (give me Times New Roman any day) may not be the best to use in certain situations.</p>
<p>Take websites, for instance. Experts recommend Sans Serif fonts for online purposes (those without “<a href="https://www.awai.com/2011/10/the-best-fonts-to-use-in-print-online-and-email/">little feet and embellishments on the tip and base of each letter</a>,”) and Serif fonts for printed material.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-57505 size-full" src="https://www.marketleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Serif-Fonts.png" alt="serif font vs. sans serif font visual" width="589" height="195" /></p>
<p>Advertising legend David Ogilvy preferred the Century family, Caslon, Baskerville, and Jenson, according to Awai.com’s John Wood.</p>
<h3>The pros at landmarksigns.com suggest the following fonts:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Futura</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Garamond</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Helvetica</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Trajan</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Verdana</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your phone number is the most important element of your real estate sign’s lettering, so consider using what the highway sign experts use:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-57503 size-full" src="https://www.marketleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Highway-Gothic-vs.-Interstate-Fonts.png" alt="Highway Gothic Font vs. Interstate Font example" width="609" height="278" /></p>
<p>Since “better legibility is obtained by using a relatively wide spacing between letters,” according to the <a href="https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/shse/design.pdf">U.S. Department of Transportation</a>, the Interstate font seems to be the best choice.</p>
<p>Not all agents can choose their real estate signs. If you can, use the space wisely.</p>
<p>And, if you work under a broker who insists that the phone number on a real estate sign can’t be larger than the broker’s name, it’s time to strike out on your own.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/real-estate-yard-signs-what-where-and-why/">Real Estate Yard Signs: What, Where, and Why</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>
