										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are two ways to approach this.</p>
<p>You could create a real estate business plan to avoid failure. Many agents go that route and find some level of success. There’s nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p>But there’s another way. You could create a business plan, not just because it reduces the risk of failure, but because it maximizes your growth potential.</p>
<p>What follows is an invitation to do just that – to go through the process of refining intentionality, elevating accountability, and igniting motivation so you can be more productive. Year after year.</p>
<p>What if 2023 was the year you generated more leads and closed more deals than ever before? It’s possible. But only if you have a plan to follow.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">The Real Estate Business Plan Checklist</h2>
<p>To provide the big-picture view, here are the action items you’ll need to include in your plan for this year:</p>
<ul class="BlogUL">
<li class="BlogLI">Note learnings from 2022</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Calculate your expenses</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Set goals</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Create a marketing plan</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Develop a system for tracking your progress</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re going to take a close look at each. But if you want to hop on the fast track, download the <a href="#download">2023 Real Estate Business Plan</a> and you can get started right away. This free, interactive guide from Market Leader covers everything on that checklist and more. Plus, you’ll get downloadable templates for calculating expenses, setting goals, planning your marketing, and tracking progress.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">5 Year-End Reflection Questions To Consider</h2>
<p>Sometimes you have to look back before you can move forward. Use the questions below as a way to reflect on last year’s performance so you can identify your business’s strengths, weaknesses, and potential.</p>
<ol class="BlogOL">
<li class="BlogLI">Which aspects of my real estate business <strong>occupied most of my time and attention</strong> last year?</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Which aspects of my business <strong>performed best</strong> last year? (For example, maybe you received many referrals, responded quickly to leads, or executed a strong social media campaign.)</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Based on last year’s performance, which aspects of my business <strong>are most in need of improvement</strong>?</li>
<li class="BlogLI">What are the <strong>top two or three mistakes</strong> I made last year that I need to learn from for 2023?</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>What would “success” look like</strong> specifically for my business in 2023?</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Calculate Your Expenses</h2>
<p>Believe it or not, tracking your expenses is an important prerequisite to maximizing your gross commission income for 2023. If you have the right expense-tracking system in place, you’ll get more of your hard-earned income back at the end of the year.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to track all of your deductible business expenses. You may be surprised to learn about the <a href="https://outfront.kw.com/training/11-tax-deductions-every-real-estate-agent-should-know-about/">many ways you can reduce the amount you owe to the IRS</a>. For example, you might even be eligible to deduct expenses related to software, marketing, advertising, and lead generation. Refer to <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p535.pdf">IRS Publication 535</a> for details and be sure to consult with your CPA or financial advisor so you don’t miss out on any money-saving tips.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Two of the Best Ways to Track Your Expenses</h3>
<ul class="BlogUL">
<li class="BlogLI">Use an app. There are many free and low-cost options that allow you to categorize and track your expenses on the go. For example, check out <a href="https://www.spendee.com/">Spendee</a> or <a href="https://dollarbird.co/">Dollarbird</a>. They’re both simple and user-friendly, and they both have options to get you started for less than $5 per month.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Download the free “Expense Tracker” template in Market Leader’s <a href="#download">2023 Real Estate Business Plan</a>. It provides space for you to calculate your personal living expenses and all of your various business expenses all in one place.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Set Your Real Estate Business Goals</h2>
<p>Start by <strong>identifying your average commission per transaction</strong>. Multiply the <a href="https://www.realtor.com/research/market-trends/">median listing price in your area</a> by your commission percentage rate.</p>
<p>Once you’ve calculated your expenses and you’ve figured out roughly how much you’ll bring in from each transaction, you’ll be informed enough to establish an <strong>attainable income goal for 2023</strong>.</p>
<p>From there you can determine how many transactions you’ll need for the year.</p>
<p>The Formula: A ÷ B = C</p>
<p>A. Your 2023 Income Goal<br />
B. Estimated Commission Per Transaction<br />
C. Transactions Needed for the Year</p>
<p>To drill down even farther, check out Market Leader’s free <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/leadcalculator/">Lead Calculator</a>. Simply punch in the numbers you’re aiming for, and the calculator will tell you how many transactions and leads you’ll need across all lead sources to reach your income goal.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Create a Marketing Plan</h2>
<p>Maybe you’re on your way to “top-performer” status, but you don’t have a great plan for getting more clients and increasing your gross commission income. Or maybe you have a plan, but it’s not working.</p>
<p>Either way, you’ll benefit from learning how to <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/real-estate-marketing-plan/">craft a well-developed real estate marketing plan</a> that’s specifically designed to help you <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/products/real-estate-leads/">generate more leads</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick outline sketch of what that would look like in practical terms.</p>
<ul class="BlogUL">
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Build your brand.</strong> Establish a brand identity that includes a mission statement, vision statement, and a value proposition.</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Define your target market.</strong> You can’t be everything to everyone. If you try, your brand will end up blending in instead of standing out. So take the time to identify who fits within your audience.</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Collect data.</strong> When you’re armed with statistics, analytics, and insights, you’re better able to set goals, track progress, and make your success repeatable. Without data, your marketing efforts are more likely to be a complete gamble, if not a guessing game.</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Get marketing automation tools.</strong> With <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/products/professional-for-agents/">Market Leader Professional</a>, for example, you get a customizable, lead-generating website and a fully integrated CRM. Plus, you can automate new listing alerts and even create newsletters and content pieces like postcards, flyers, and video-enabled mobile-responsive emails.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Track Your Progress</h2>
<p>Why is performance-tracking necessary?</p>
<ul class="BlogUL">
<li class="BlogLI">It’s a way of <strong>holding yourself accountable</strong> to the goals you set.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">It provides you with the <strong>feedback</strong> you need to make strategic adjustments.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">It enables you to create <strong>new benchmarks</strong> for future goals.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">It takes the guesswork out of your <strong>professional self-reflection</strong>.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">It’s the most efficient way to <strong>spot what’s working well and what needs improvement</strong>.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">It helps you <strong>prioritize</strong> and keeps you focused on what matters most.</li>
</ul>
<p>It doesn’t have to be time-consuming and complicated. It can be as easy as creating a basic table in your favorite word processor or spreadsheet software, writing down all of your goals in the left column, and using the rest of the columns to note your performance each month (or week).</p>

<p>Still not sure if you’re ready to take the first step? That’s okay. To give you an idea of what to expect, here’s a sketch of some of the concepts covered in the full guide.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">What Is a Real Estate Marketing Plan?</h2>
<p>A real estate marketing plan is an organized collection of strategies, systems, and schedules that individual agents, teams, and brokerages use to guide their marketing efforts.</p>
<p>Every marketing plan for real estate must incorporate the five essential components listed below.</p>
<p>Which (if any) do you already have in place?</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">A Brand Structure</h3>
<p>If you have a weak brand, you’re more likely to lose focus, disappear in the crowd of competition, and misrepresent who you are as an agent. All of which reduces productivity and hinders your ability to acquire and retain quality leads.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH3">Data &amp; Analytics</h2>
<p>When you’re armed with statistics, analytics, and insights, you’re better able to set goals, track progress, and make your success repeatable. Without data, your marketing efforts are more likely to be a complete gamble, if not a guessing game.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">An Understanding of Consumers’ New Expectations</h3>
<p>Service providers of all kinds are constantly adjusting the way they do business to keep up with changes in technology, tactics, and trends. Are you aware of what prospects and clients expect of you as a real estate agent? If not, you risk falling to the background.</p>
<p>For example, most of today’s consumers expect prompt communication via text message. In a <a href="https://cdn.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/2022-home-buyers-and-sellers-generational-trends-03-23-2022.pdf">2022 report from the National Association of Realtors</a> (NAR), 71% of buyers said it was “important” to receive property information and communication from their agent via text message. Whereas in <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/reports/2015/2015-home-buyer-and-seller-generational-trends-2015-03-11.pdf">2015</a> – just seven years earlier – that figure was only 45%.</p>
<p>Consumers expectations change fast, and you need to keep up.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Social Proof</h3>
<p>Speaking of what consumers want, near the top of the list is authentic proof of your competency, especially in the form of reviews and testimonials. In what ways could you add social proof to your marketing efforts? Common ways for agents include requesting reviews on their Facebook pages or Zillow profiles.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Technology &amp; Tools</h3>
<p>The best real estate marketing plans include a social media strategy, video content, <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/solutions/marketing-automation/">robust marketing automation tools</a>, a <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/solutions/customizable-websites/">customizable real estate website</a>, and a <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/solutions/crm/">fully-integrated CRM</a>. But of course, merely having the right tools won’t be enough. You have to know how to use them.</p>
<p>Learn how. <a style="font-weight: 800;" href="#download">Download our free “2023 Real Estate Marketing Plan”</a> and make today the day you begin taking your business to the next level.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Only SMART Goals Will Produce the Results You Want</h2>
<p>Goal-setting is a crucial part of marketing for real estate agents. And maybe you’ve already established goals, but you’re not seeing the results you want.</p>
<p>The reason may be that they’re not SMART goals: smart, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound.</p>
<p>This approach enables you to set realistic goals while also increasing the likelihood that you’ll actually achieve them.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">3 Examples of SMART Goals</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>“I will increase the average number of leads I generate every month by 20 percent by the end of 2023.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I will attend one webinar or download one guide about lead generation best practices every month throughout 2023.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I will 1) research which real estate website provider has the best websites for generating leads and 2) implement a new website from that provider by the end of the first quarter.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Want a full breakdown of each part of the acronym so you can start setting results-producing goals today? <a style="font-weight: 800;" href="#download">Get our free interactive marketing planning guide.</a></p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">5 Must-Have Real Estate Marketing Strategies</h2>
<p>Goals are worthless if you don’t have specific strategies in place to help you reach them. Think of them as the difference between planning and wishful thinking. They are the “how” to your “what.”</p>
<p>It would be impossible to list <em>all</em> of the many strategies you could implement as part of your marketing plan. Plus, it wouldn’t be very helpful for you to skim through a dizzying array of possibilities. Instead, let’s narrow it down to five real estate marketing ideas that are sure to generate more leads.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Invest in Advertising</h3>
<p>In the <a style="font-weight: 800;" href="#download">“2023 Real Estate Marketing Plan,”</a> not only will you get practical pro tips for advertising, but you’ll also get a customizable budgeting calendar so you can put money where your <em>month</em> is.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Develop a Strategy for Referrals</h3>
<p>Imagine if every one of your former clients referred someone to you every year. That’s totally conceivable, and the success would be compounding – and life-changing! The guide gives you three ideas to jumpstart your referral strategy brainstorming session.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Use Marketing Automation Tools</h3>
<p>The best marketing automation tools do it all. With <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/products/professional-for-agents/">Market Leader Professional</a>, for example, you get a customizable, lead-generating website; a fully-integrated CRM; and the ability to automate new listing alerts, newsletters, and print and digital content pieces like postcards, flyers, and video-enabled mobile-responsive emails.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Leverage the Power of Social Media</h3>
<p>To give you a shortcut for implementing an efficient and productive social media strategy, the <a style="font-weight: 800;" href="#download">“2023 Real Estate Marketing Plan”</a> provides a handy “Social Media Cheat Sheet” so you’ll know the audience, tone, and user intentions applicable for each channel.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Get Exclusive Buyer &amp; Seller Leads Delivered to You Each Month</h3>
<p>Securing a steady stream of exclusive online leads each month cuts down on the time you have to spend on prospecting, while also putting you in a better position to plan for the future. For example, Market Leader offers <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/products/real-estate-leads/">real estate leads</a> which will empower you to reach your sales goals and sidestep the stressful boom-and-bust cycle.</p>
<h2 id="download" class="BlogH2">What Else Is Included in the Guide?</h2>
<p>In addition to all that we alluded to above, the “2023 Real Estate Marketing Plan” also provides the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information about how to build your brand, including your unique value proposition, mission statement, vision statement, and target audience</li>
<li>The “Marketing Audit” worksheet</li>
<li>The “SWOT Analysis” worksheet</li>
<li>The “Digital Marketing Toolkit”</li>
<li>And most importantly, the “Create Your Marketing Plan” worksheet where you can pull it all together to craft a comprehensive, actionable, results-oriented plan of your own to generate more leads than ever before</li>
</ul>
<p>Every big plan starts with a small decision. Will you download Market Leader’s free interactive real estate marketing plan?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You know all that stuff you want potential clients to know about you? How easy you are to work with, how experienced and knowledgeable you are and how you saved a particular transaction?</p>
<p>You can, as many agents do, create a space on your website to list all of that. But most of these pieces come off as far too salesy and way too much like what every other agent in town says about themselves.</p>
<p>And, it’s not just real estate agent marketing that creates skepticism in consumers – today, any claims by any company that aren’t backed up by consumer reviews are treated with suspicion.</p>
<h2><strong>If you aren’t collecting agent reviews – aka testimonials &#8212; from your clients, you should start</strong></h2>
<p>More than 85 percent of consumers check a local business’ reviews online, according to the Local Consumer Review Survey 2018 from <a href="https://www.brightlocal.com/research/local-consumer-review-survey/">BrightLocal.com</a> a firm that offers reputation management services, among others.</p>
<p>And, 27 percent of these consumers looked for a business review online daily, the study claims.</p>
<p>Sadly, more than half of those in the ideal real estate demographic (ages 35 to 54) are more likely to read reviews for restaurants and cafés than real estate agents.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean they don’t check real estate agent reviews, because they do.</p>
<h2><strong>It’s “social proof” and all agents need it</strong></h2>
<p>“ … we determine what is correct by finding out what other people think is correct,” according to psychologist <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/006124189X/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0">Robert Cialdini</a>, who coined the phrase “social proof” in his 2009 book, <em>Influence: Science and Practice.</em></p>
<p>It’s a bit hard to admit that we’re basically sheep, looking to others to find out what is correct, what is “best.” But that’s exactly what we do, especially when we’re feeling uncertain.</p>
<p>“Uncertainty is the fuel that activates and feeds the mechanisms of social proof. When faced with an unfamiliar situation, an unsure individual would feel the need to refer to other people for guidance,” claims an unnamed writer at <a href="https://www.psychologynoteshq.com/social-proof/">PsychologyNotesHQ.com</a>.</p>
<p>In real estate, social proof offers proof of your credibility, removes that uncertainty (thereby instilling trust) and helps consumers get to know you.</p>
<h2><strong>How to choose which testimonials to use in your marketing</strong></h2>
<p>Believe it or not, not all reviews that seem “good” are actually good for your marketing efforts. Thankfully, surveys and studies show us which ones to trash and which to use.</p>
<h3>Regardless of how amazing a review is, don’t use it if any of the following apply:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The review is older than three months. Consumers find these reviews irrelevant.</li>
<li>Reviews that are unsigned or use initials. Zillow or Yelp usernames instead of real names destroys the value of a review. Consumers think they are “fake.” Ask your clients to use their first and last name when they leave a review.</li>
</ul>
<h3>According to the Bright Local survey, consumers place the most value on the number of stars in a rating and then, in order of importance to them:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Quantity of reviews</li>
<li>Recency</li>
<li>Length/detail</li>
<li>Sentiment of the review</li>
<li>Business response or non/response</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>How to use your real estate agent reviews</strong></h2>
<p>Naturally you should have a section of your website devoted to your testimonials, but don’t stop there.</p>
<p>Choose one line from one of your favorite reviews. Ensure it encapsulates exactly why a real estate consumer should choose you above all other agents in your market.</p>
<p>It’s tempting to choose the most flattering-to-your-ego testimonial, but don’t do it. A <a href="https://magazine.realtor/sales-and-marketing/feature/article/2015/03/what-your-online-about-me-says-about-you">REALTOR® Magazine survey</a> of real estate consumers finds that they are “strongly critical of agents who posted testimonials that appeared overly self-serving.”</p>
<p>Instead, choose one that highlights your success in overcoming a typical real estate consumer pain point.</p>
<p>A testimonial that mentioned how the agent sold the home “in 19 days for asking price” was particularly attractive to the panelists in the aforementioned survey.</p>
<p>One panelist said that the days on market mention gave the testimonia credibility, “considering many online agent reviews are less detailed and sound automated.”</p>
<p>Consider this when choosing that one line from a testimonial. If you’re having trouble choosing, ask a non-real estate related friend or family member to read your testimonials and pick out one sentence that would make them want to call you.</p>
<p>Then, use that one-line quote above the fold on your website, in your email signature and wherever else you can plaster it.</p>
<p>Real estate reviews allow consumers to get an idea of what you’re like to work with, how well you negotiate, market and overall perform your job.</p>
<p>They can also help boost your credibility and instill trust.</p>
<p>Whether it’s where to eat dinner on Friday night, which movie to watch or which real estate agent to choose, social proof, in the form of reviews, is one of the most powerful marketing tools around.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/how-to-maximize-the-power-of-real-estate-agent-reviews-testimonials/">How to Maximize the Power of Real Estate Agent Reviews & Testimonials</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>A Simple Guide to Real Estate Yard Signs</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Are your real estate signs working as hard as they should?</strong></h2>
<p>Did you know that there is a “Standard Alphabets for Highway Signs” book? And, who knew that there exists in the U.S. the Foundation for the Advancement of the Sign Industry?</p>
<p>In fact, highway signage has a whole set of rules that we’re willing to wager few of agents consider when sticking for-sale real estate signs in a client’s lawn.</p>
<p>It only makes sense, however, when we <em>do</em> think about it. For the public’s safety, highway signs must be legible from certain distances.</p>
<p>For an entirely different reason, real estate signs also need to be legible from certain distances.</p>
<p>Here we are in 2019, well past the dawn of the digital age, and little has changed with real estate signage. They’re still stuck in the front yard or window of a home for sale, they still get muddy and many agents still make the same mistakes with them.</p>
<p>Of course, any discussion of real estate signage should be prefaced with the caveat that the majority of brokers and franchise owners dictate the use of their branded signs, so many agents don’t have a choice of what is on their real estate signs.</p>
<p>If you do have a choice, read on for information on how to make your real estate signs work hard to bring in buyers and, quite possibly generate additional real estate leads.</p>
<h2><strong>Remember the sign’s true purpose</strong></h2>
<p>One agent in a Facebook group brags that his signs are emblazoned with a very large copy of his logo. He loves the feedback he gets from the public.</p>
<p>“I get calls from people who say things like ‘I can’t turn in this town without seeing your sign.’”</p>
<p>It’s cool to get accolades from others, but the only accolades you should be aiming for with your real estate signs are those from your listing clients to all the folks they’ll be referring to your business.</p>
<p>And that won’t happen if your real estate signs are vanity signs.</p>
<p>Listing clients hire agents to market their homes for sale, not to market themselves. It’s dishonest to use your clients’ front yard to erect a monument to yourself.</p>
<p>A real estate sign’s main job is to clearly and concisely convey the listing agent’s contact information. And you can do so in a number of ways.</p>
<h2><strong>What color is your real estate sign? </strong></h2>
<p>“During the day, our eyes are most easily able to pick up green light, followed by yellow and blue,” according to April Sanders at Sciencing.com.</p>
<p>Red, on the other hand, is the least easy to view from a distance. At night, yellow is most visible.</p>
<p>So, what does this mean for real estate signs? No, we aren’t advocating you change your branding colors to suit your signage, but do consider that the phone number, the most important element of your sign, might look dashing in yellow against a green background.</p>
<h2><strong>Typography</strong></h2>
<p>One rule of thumb in the signage industry is that the individual letters on a real estate sign should measure 1 inch in height for every 30 feet in distance from the viewer.</p>
<p>“Thus, if a sign must be readable from 300 feet, its letters must be at least 10 inches tall,” according to Wade Swormstedt, executive director of the Foundation for the Advancement of the Sign Industry.</p>
<p>Since the widely accepted <a href="https://plannersweb.com/">width of a residential street</a>, from curb-to-curb, is 28 feet, the minimum height of the phone number on your sign should be 10 inches tall. That way, the family passing by on the other side of the street can see it.</p>
<p>For another take on letter height in signage, check out <a href="https://www.signazon.com/help-center/sign-letter-height-visibility-chart.aspx">this signage chart</a>.</p>
<p>It’s interesting how the digital age ushered in an attention to typography. Everyone has a favorite font, right?</p>
<p>The problem is that our favorites (give me Times New Roman any day) may not be the best to use in certain situations.</p>
<p>Take websites, for instance. Experts recommend Sans Serif fonts for online purposes (those without “<a href="https://www.awai.com/2011/10/the-best-fonts-to-use-in-print-online-and-email/">little feet and embellishments on the tip and base of each letter</a>,”) and Serif fonts for printed material.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-57505 size-full" src="https://www.marketleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Serif-Fonts.png" alt="serif font vs. sans serif font visual" width="589" height="195" /></p>
<p>Advertising legend David Ogilvy preferred the Century family, Caslon, Baskerville, and Jenson, according to Awai.com’s John Wood.</p>
<h3>The pros at landmarksigns.com suggest the following fonts:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Futura</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Garamond</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Helvetica</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Trajan</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Verdana</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your phone number is the most important element of your real estate sign’s lettering, so consider using what the highway sign experts use:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-57503 size-full" src="https://www.marketleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Highway-Gothic-vs.-Interstate-Fonts.png" alt="Highway Gothic Font vs. Interstate Font example" width="609" height="278" /></p>
<p>Since “better legibility is obtained by using a relatively wide spacing between letters,” according to the <a href="https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/shse/design.pdf">U.S. Department of Transportation</a>, the Interstate font seems to be the best choice.</p>
<p>Not all agents can choose their real estate signs. If you can, use the space wisely.</p>
<p>And, if you work under a broker who insists that the phone number on a real estate sign can’t be larger than the broker’s name, it’s time to strike out on your own.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/real-estate-yard-signs-what-where-and-why/">Real Estate Yard Signs: What, Where, and Why</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>How to utilize real estate mailers in 2019</strong></h1>
<p>While never completely “dead,” direct mail real estate marketing is seeing a resurgence. Experts chalk it up to the overuse of email marketing, but direct mail outperforms <em>most</em> digital marketing tactics, according to the <a href="https://thedma.org/marketing-insights/response-rate-report/">Association of National Advertisers</a> (ANA).</p>
<p>Direct mail marketing’s “response rate ranges from about five to nine times greater than that of email, paid search, or social media,” according to the pros at datatargetingsolutions.com.</p>
<p>Pretty impressive, right? Yet, at least in the real estate industry, it seems to be a very well-kept secret.</p>
<p>This leaves the door wide open for agents seeking an additional marketing vehicle and a way to stand out from the crowd.</p>
<h2><strong>People Trust Direct Mail</strong></h2>
<p>A couple of years ago, the folks at <a href="https://www.marketingsherpa.com/article/chart/channels-customers-trust-most-when-purchasing">MarketingSherpa.com</a> conducted a  study to determine “which advertising channels consumers trust most and least when making purchases.” The results are quite interesting:</p>
<div id="attachment_57359" style="width: 1148px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.marketingsherpa.com/article/chart/channels-customers-trust-most-when-purchasing"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-57359" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-57359 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Marketing-Sherpa-Chart.png" alt="Here’s a chart that suggests, in real estate, direct mail may be the most trusted advertising channel." width="1138" height="635" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-57359" class="wp-caption-text">Source: MarketingSherpa</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notice how all of the channels that have been pronounced “dead” top everything digital. Interestingly, 43 percent more of the respondents trust direct mail than Facebook and other social media ads.</p>
<p>Since trust is something high on the list of qualities that real estate consumers seek in an agent, maybe it’s time to add something “new” to the marketing mix.</p>
<h2><strong>Real Estate Mailers: What to Send</strong></h2>
<p>When I separate my mail every day, I put the garbage-looking mail in one pile and the stuff I’ll read in another. Every month I receive a market update from a real estate team here in town and that goes in the keep pile.</p>
<p>I enjoy learning what my home might be worth by comparing it to recently sold homes. I can’t for the life of me remember the couple’s name that sends me this report and I trash it after reading it.</p>
<p>Would I use them to sell my home? Never. Although I respect their consistency in mailing to me each month for the past three years, the report is ugly. It appears to be an Excel graph that they’ve reproduced on their office copier.</p>
<p>Sometimes they don’t even bother to center the paper in the copier and the image is crooked. It’s in black and white on flimsy paper.</p>
<p>In other words, if they put such little care into how they market themselves, I don’t think I’ll take a chance and hope that they’ll put more effort into marketing my home.</p>
<p>But they do get one thing right: they send it in a business-sized envelope without branding, and they send it consistently.</p>
<p>A recent ANA/DMA study of direct mail response rates finds that the old-fashioned business-sized envelope (also known as “letter-sized” and #10) “produced the best median response rate overall – 15.1%.”</p>
<p>Use these for your sales letters, newsletters and other items printed on paper. Don’t brand the envelopes; hand address each.</p>
<p>Yes, it sounds labor- and time-intensive, and it is. But if it increases the chance that recipients will open your mail, it’s worth all the time it takes.</p>
<h3><strong>Real Estate Postcards</strong></h3>
<p>Scientists at Temple University’s Fox School of Business, Center for Neural Decision Making and the U.S. Postal Service Office of Inspector General (OIG) teamed up to <a href="https://www.uspsoig.gov/sites/default/files/document-library-files/2015/rarc-wp-15-012.pdf">study</a> the circumstances under which email or direct mail was more effective.</p>
<p>Postcards were more effective in five of the nine tests performed.</p>
<p>If you include postcards in your real estate mailing campaign, choose unusual shapes and sizes to help them stand out in the pile of mail most of us receive.</p>
<p>Be aware, though, that these may cost more to mail than it does to send a standard postcard. “Generally, mailpieces [sic] that are 1/4-inch thick or less MUST be rectangular. Pieces more than 1/4-inch thick do not have to be rectangular,” to avoid increased cost, according to the <a href="https://pe.usps.com/businessmail101?ViewName=MailpieceShape">U.S. Postal Service</a>.</p>
<p>Use postcards with powerful images (local images if possible) and little text. The time-tested Just Listed and Just Sold postcards still work, but consider a postcard containing just your most compelling testimonial and contact information.</p>
<h4>Other ideas we’ve learned from agents who use direct mail include:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>An invitation to your event</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Invitation to an open house</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>A map of the recipients’ neighborhood, dotted with “pins” denoting recent listings and sales.</h5>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Real Estate Fliers</strong></h3>
<p>Consider oversized cards or even fliers with your message on one side and something of value to the recipient on the other. Here’s an example we found from <a href="https://kopywritingkourse.com/blog/">Kopywriting Kourse</a>&#8216;s website.</p>
<div id="attachment_57353" style="width: 387px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-57353" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-57353 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Flier-Front-Page.jpg" alt="Looking for real estate direct mail ideas? Try a flyer." width="377" height="494" /><p id="caption-attachment-57353" class="wp-caption-text">Flier Front</p></div>
<div id="attachment_57361" style="width: 394px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-57361" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-57361 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/flyer-back-page.jpg" alt="Real estate direct mail best practice: offer value" width="384" height="499" /><p id="caption-attachment-57361" class="wp-caption-text">Flier Back</p></div>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Although the first image (the front of the piece) is attractive, we think that the value offered (the event calendar on the back of the piece) should greet the recipient first. Put the salesy stuff on the back.</p>
<p>Consider creating cool, real estate-related infographic flyers. Here’s an example of a colorful, eye-catching, easy-to-read infographic, from Illinois Association of REALTORS®, using information they gleaned from Realtor.com.</p>
<div id="attachment_57355" style="width: 490px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-57355" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-57355 size-full" src="http://www.marketleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Ill-asso-realtors-infograph-buying-vs-renting.jpg" alt="Infographics make for excellent real estate direct mail piece." width="480" height="620" /><p id="caption-attachment-57355" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Illinois Association of REALTORS®</p></div>
<h4>Other timely topics (at least in some markets) include:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Cost to rent vs. buy a home</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>A comparison of the FHA and conventional loan</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Sales price of a staged home vs. un-staged home</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Sales price of a seller-assisted vs. FSBO listing</h5>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a lot of companies that offer direct-mail pieces and assistance with mailing. If you&#8217;re a Market Leader user, you&#8217;ve got thousands of on-demand marketing pieces directly in your <a href="/solutions/marketing-automation/">system</a> that provides discounted pricing through Shutterfly, MLS integration, and the option to add print mailers to any marketing campaign.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/real-estate-mailers/">Real Estate Mailers: Using Direct Mail to Stand Out</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OK, who is the wise guy (or gal) who first suggested that folding your arms for your real estate business card photo is cool?</p>
<p>We don’t know for sure, but it seems like nine out of 10 agents have chosen this pose. It’s a particularly curious practice in a business where practitioners say they crave a way to set themselves apart from others.</p>
<p>Same pose.</p>
<p>Same smile.</p>
<p>“It’s contagious. One of them gets an idea and it spreads through the body like a flu,” House of Cards’ President Frank Underwood claims.</p>
<p>If that’s true, members of the Senate and real estate agents have a lot in common.</p>
<p>With real estate agent business cards, you have just seven square inches to convey your message. If half of that is taken up by your photo, and your photo screams “Nothing unique to look at here!” you’re doing yourself no favors.</p>
<p>So, how can you use that valuable space for all it’s worth? We went to the experts to find out.</p>
<h2>To headshot or not?</h2>
<p>The arguments for using a photo on a real estate business card equal the number against. Southern California broker/agent Mellissa Zavala is in both camps, feeling that some situations call for a card with her photo.</p>
<p>She solves the dilemma by carrying two different cards, one with and one without her headshot. The former is used in “situations where I want to people to remember more than just my name,” Zavala claims.</p>
<p>Other agents feel that the photo is important, but not so much that it should take up the more valuable “real estate” of the tiny business card. These agents put their photo on the back.</p>
<p>Eric Bryn, attorney, adjunct professor at Loyola University, and Chicago broker points out that professionals in other industries don’t plaster their business cards with their photos (they don’t offer their clients gifts at the end of a business deal either, but that’s fodder for another blog post).</p>
<p>“In the space where the headshot goes, why not add a core value statement?” he asks. He goes on to explain an even bigger reason he’s against the ubiquitous agent photo on business cards. “A few years back we did a really cool test,” he begins. “We printed 2000 post cards for a client. Same exact message on both. One had a picture of an agent on the card, the other did not.</p>
<p>Both had a very clear and defined call to action &#8211; a phone number. Each had a different number so we could get accurate results,” Bryn explains.<br />
He and his team sent 1,000 of each card to area addresses. The results are pretty astounding.</p>
<p>They got zero response from the 1,000 cards sent out that contained the agent’s photo and nearly 200 responses from the 1,000 cards that lacked a photo.<br />
Bryn goes on to explain that they’ve done similar tests on other types of agent marketing, such as webpages, whole sites, business cards and more. In every test, he claims, the marketing piece without the agent’s photo out-performs the one with the photo.</p>
<p>They have never found, “a situation where an image of an agent increases conversation. What we find is, it completely obliterates it.”<br />
Agents and brokers who do recommend using a photo on a business card stress that the photo should be recent and professionally shot.</p>
<h2>Agent – Heal Thyself</h2>
<p>When counselling your listing clients on how to ensure their homes make a brilliant first impression, you suggest that they clean and declutter, right? Then, as you walk out the door, you remind them to call you if they need anything, handing them a business card that is full of clutter.<br />
From the string of letters behind your name to a fax number, a headshot and every conceivable way to contact you, the card looks a bit like an ugly home page on a website.</p>
<p>Cleaning up the clutter on your business card may help yours avoid being among the 88 percent that are tossed into the trash within the first week of receiving them.</p>
<h4>Give your logo the space you devoted to your headshot and then include:</h4>
<h5 style="padding-left: 30px;">• Name (personal and brokerage)<br />
• Email address<br />
• Phone number<br />
• Website URL<br />
• URL of the social media site you’re most active on</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Pay attention to aesthetics</h2>
<p>Designing a business card is a lot like designing a website; some of the same aesthetics apply.</p>
<h5 style="padding-left: 30px;">• Font choice<br />
• Color<br />
• Lots of white space</h5>
<p>In fact, experts recommend that you use your website branding concept on your business card.</p>
<p>Card stock is something you’ll need to think about as well. “When I receive a business card, I create an opinion about the company as soon as the card touches my hand. Is it thin and flimsy? Is it thick cardstock?” Chris Ake of Grand Apps asks the Forbes Agency Council.</p>
<p>“Cheap business cards get printed on: 100 lb. gloss cover,” suggests Andrew Shu, with MGX Copy, a San Diego print company. He goes on to say, however, that a card printed on this stock “feels perfectly fine, and it doesn’t feel cheap.”</p>
<p>Fourteen and 15-point card stocks, on the other hand, “feel very corporate and professional.”</p>
<h2>Has technology killed the business card?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>All of the above depends, of course, on which camp you’re in when it comes to business cards:</h4>
<h5 style="padding-left: 30px;">• They are a must for real estate agents – old-school has merit<br />
• This is the 21st century – business cards are outdated</h5>
<p>Personally, I can’t recall the last time I received a business card. Even the agent who helped me buy my home two years ago didn’t proffer one.</p>
<p>“Business cards still hold a purpose, which is quickly exchanging information at events, conferences and other networking opportunities,” Leila Lewis of Be Inspired PR tells Forbes.com.</p>
<p>Mark Sims, founder of Foundation, a design and branding company, claims that it’s the smartphone that has killed the business card,“ . . . we can swap and store contact information with one another with a simple tap of the phone,” he says, which does away with the need for a business card. This “tap,” however, doesn’t “carry forward your brand identity,” he continues.</p>
<p>If this is important to you, keep using business cards. And, unless you hope to mimic the Black Astrum card ($1,500 per card and, yes, those are real diamonds), business cards remain an economical way to broadcast your brand.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/real-estate-business-card-tips-for-agents/">Real Estate Business Card Tips for Agents</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Real estate agents: Win the hearts of your community &#8211; <em>and</em> clients.</h1>
<p>It’s not easy to <a href="/blog/realestatebusiness/">stand out among the crowd of other agents</a>, which is why so many agents choose to go the overtly-self-promotional route. This, by the way, does nothing to endear anyone to them.</p>
<blockquote><p>“You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you,” according to Dale Carnegie.</p></blockquote>
<p>Showing an interest in others and in your community is good for them <em>and</em> good for your business.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at several ways you can show that interest and reap big rewards &#8212; emotionally, spiritually and economically.</p>
<h2>Pay it forward</h2>
<p>Even when money was tight during the recession, more than half of respondents to a poll claimed that they would choose a service from a socially responsible company over one that isn’t, regardless of price.</p>
<p>Today, surveys show that 90 percent of consumers say they are “likely to switch to brands that support a good cause,” according to frontstream.com.</p>
<p>Yes, you’re busy, but associating your brand with a cause that is near and dear to your heart (or your clients’)  not only helps the community but gives a boost to your brand’s recognition.</p>
<p>One of the easiest ways to get the most bang for your buck is to dedicate a percentage of each commission check to a worthy and needy cause. We found two companies that go all out helping agents not only give to a cause they are passionate about but assists them with tying their philanthropy to their brand.</p>
<h3>Give Back Homes</h3>
<p><strong>Give Back Homes</strong> provides agents a profile page to customize and share with their spheres of influence, on social media and in marketing materials. They also help agents organize community events and they provide other tools to help them stand out as socially responsible real estate pros, dedicated to the areas they serve.</p>
<p>Check them out at <a href="https://givebackhomes.com/how-we-work">givebackhomes.com.</a></p>
<h3>Agent with Heart<strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Agent with Heart<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong> program is similar in scope. Agents pledge to donate to their client’s choice of nonprofit at the close of escrow. PinRaise, the company who created Agent with Heart, then manages the process and provides custom marketing materials (including a very cool video you can post on your site and social media) for the agent to use.</p>
<p>Learn more about the Agent with Heart program at <a href="https://pinraise.com/">pinraise.com</a>.</p>
<p>Then, there are individual brokerages that hire agents who agree that giving back is important. Austin’s Give Realty is a brilliant example of how to combine paying it forward and marketing your business.</p>
<p>Take a look at just <a href="http://www.giverealty.com/about/how-we-did-it/">one page on their website</a>, promoting their program (it’s highlighted on many pages across the site).</p>
<h2>Give of your time</h2>
<p>Out of all of the ways to win the hearts of the community, we think volunteering your time is one of the best. Not only are you helping your community, but your hands-on approach will give you exposure and access to other, like-minded community members (aka potential clients and friends).</p>
<p>It’s so much easier for them to get to know, like and trust you when they work with you, rather than through your website.</p>
<blockquote><p>“If you’re not volunteering in your community you’re doing your neighborhood a disservice,” according to Brentwood, CA agent Cathy Daniel. “If I won mega millions tomorrow, I’d be a professional volunteer.”</p></blockquote>
<p>If you have a passion, then you have a good idea of where to give your time. If you don’t know where to start, we offer advice on <a href="/blog/how-community-involvement-can-help-your-real-estate-business/">community involvement for real estate agents</a> in a previous article.</p>
<h2>It’s all about the kids</h2>
<p>Members of Generation X have one overriding priority in their lives: their kids. Just about everything they do is filtered through the parenthood lens.</p>
<p>And, since this is the generation most likely to sell one home to buy another in the near future, involving yourself in their community is the ideal way to get to know them.</p>
<p>It just so happens that this cohort volunteers more than any other, so you should find yourself surrounded by your ideal real estate client. In fact, according to the Corporation for National &amp; Community Service, in 2015, nearly 20 million members of Generation X provided slightly more than 2 billion hours of service.</p>
<h4>Ideas for volunteer opportunities where you can rub shoulders with this cohort include:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Sponsoring a youth sports team – Leagues typically offer sponsorship packages that may include website mentions of your business, the opportunity to have your brand on the field’s signage or the team’s uniforms. You can also offer team members branded water bottles. Show up for the games and bring the halftime snack.</li>
<li>Sponsor a school garden – School gardening programs are typically and woefully underfunded. Offer to sponsor the one at your local school or to help raise donations for one.</li>
<li>Start a back-to-school supply drive for teachers and low-income students – Visalia, CA agent Heather Cox held one of these in her market area. “I sent out a branded postcard asking for specific supplies that were needed in Tulare County schools,” she told Gina Thelemann at smartzip.com. The drive ended up being quite successful and she went on to organize another for pet supplies to benefit the local SPCA.</li>
</ul>
<p>Find a need that fits your passion and make the time to fill that need. Then, don’t be afraid to share your volunteer successes with your blog and social media audiences.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Make 2018 the Year You Leverage Social Proof</h2>
<p>You have tons of experience. You offer stellar customer service. You’ve developed a killer website. Even your branding is cool.</p>
<p>Guess what? It’s not enough.</p>
<p>Not in 2018.</p>
<p>Like this year’s, next year’s clients want proof before they agree to work with you. And, they want proof from people who have actually used your real estate services.</p>
<p>Make 2018 the year you focus on gathering the social proof you need to help potential clients judge your credibility as a real estate authority, get to know you, and build trust.</p>
<h3>What is social proof?</h3>
<p>A herd of sheep will instinctually stick together, for protection. Where one goes, the others follow – whether it’s back to the farm for supper or to the slaughterhouse, the instinct rules.</p>
<p>We humans have similar inclinations. A famous 1969 study (Milgram et al.) on “the drawing power of crowds of different sizes” found that 4 percent of folks passing by would stop to join one person looking up at a skyscraper.</p>
<p>When there were 15 people looking skyward, the number of passersby who stopped to join them increased to 40 percent. Additionally, 86 percent of passersby, even if they didn’t stop, would look up to see what everyone was looking at.</p>
<p>“We often imitate others’ actions when making choices with limited information about what’s best,” claims David Stipp at <a href="https://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1996/10/14/217822/index.htm">Fortune.com</a>. “It’s almost a law of nature,” he concludes.</p>
<p>It’s herd behavior and, although it can have negative consequences, it can also be a boon to your marketing efforts.</p>
<h3>Why does it matter?</h3>
<p>A majority of the 2,000 Americans surveyed by Mintel, a market analysis agency, say that online reviews dictate which products they buy and services they use.</p>
<p>It’s only natural, right? We all want to ensure that we’re purchasing the “best” product or hiring the “best” hair stylist.</p>
<p>“In a never-ending quest to buy the ‘best,’ consumers are looking to others’ opinions and experiences via online review sites to validate their choices – and to avoid feeling buyers’ remorse,” Mintel’s Fiona O’Donnell claims in their American Lifestyles 2015 study.</p>
<p>Although consumers of all ages perform this gut check, it is far more common in millennials than in older and younger generations. And, since that particular demographic represents the real estate consumers of tomorrow, social proof becomes even more important.</p>
<h3>How is your online reputation?</h3>
<p>The first thing to consider when starting a social proof campaign is to determine where you stand right now. Will you be starting with a blank slate or multitudes of reviews scattered across the internet?</p>
<p>How many negative reviews will you need to combat? Cleaning up your online reputation takes time and effort unless you have the big bucks required to hire a company to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2013/03/14/6-steps-to-managing-your-online-reputation/?sh=5a12293b7767">manage your online reputation.</a></p>
<p>And, lest you think image polishing isn’t important, consider this: 75 percent of HR professionals and recruiters say that they have “personnel to research applicants online,” according to a Cross-Tab <a href="https://www.job-hunt.org/guides/DPD_Online-Reputation-Research_overview.pdf">study</a>.</p>
<p>Even more frightening (at least for job hunters) is that 70 percent of these hiring pros claim that they have rejected candidates based on what they found out about them online.</p>
<p>Sure, you’re not hoping to be recruited, but if HR professionals seek out social proof for job applicants, it’s a safe bet that real estate consumers do the same when researching real estate agents.</p>
<h3>Types of social proof to consider for your real estate business:</h3>
<p><strong>Review sites</strong> &#8212; It’s not enough to have online reviews and testimonials on one site. Gut checkers view two to three different review sites before they make a decision, according to BrightLocal’s Consumer Review Survey 2016.</p>
<p>When researching real estate agents, these review sites typically include Yelp, Zillow and Google. Since Google search results for “real estate agents in” typically come with Google reviews, it’s a good idea to concentrate on the search giant first. Setting up a <a href="https://www.google.com/business/?gmbsrc=us-en-ha-se-z-gmb-s-z-h~bk&amp;ppsrc=GMBS0&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI8v7G8IWF1wIVCmh-Ch2LrQtWEAAYASAAEgIDkvD_BwE&amp;dclid=CImD6PeFhdcCFRB2Ygodb-APEA">Google Business Page</a> is a great place to start.</p>
<p><strong>Testimonials</strong> – BrightLocal’s survey found that the “authenticity of reviews is the most important factor for consumers to trust the reviews they read.” They want to know that these testimonials are coming from actual people – clients who have used you to represent them when buying or selling a home.</p>
<p>Bring your testimonials to life by including a photo of your clients (with their permission, of course) <a href="/blog/2018-real-estate-trends-content-marketing-reigns-king/">above</a> their glowing recommendation.</p>
<p><strong>Case studies</strong> – These are another way to give life to your testimonials. They are basically stories that illustrate a client’s problem and how you, as an agent, solved it. Not only are they effective on websites, but because of they are typically photo-intensive, they work well when included with other marketing materials, such as listing presentations and newsletters.</p>
<p><strong>Take it offline, too. </strong></p>
<p>Testimonials can be used in all of your marketing materials as long as you don’t overdo it. Choose one or two of your favorites and use them in your newsletters.</p>
<p>Use them in listing presentations, on door hangers, direct mail pieces – all of your offline marketing materials can and should contain at least one testimonial.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/2018-real-estate-trends-social-proof/">2018 Real Estate Trends: Social Proof</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(Or woman, for political correctness and inclusiveness).</p>
<p>How do you view your business as a real estate agent?  Think about it &#8211; do you invest in yourself the way any other business owner would? Do you tend to the nuances that culminate to create your brand?</p>
<p>There seems to be a common disconnect between how real estate agents perceive themselves and their business, as if they’re not one and the same. The most important element of a business in a crowded space is its brand and how it’s differentiated from the competition; i.e., how it’s perceived.</p>
<p>The reality of the real estate game is that it’s no different from any other competitive industry and requires the same level of investment, if not more when you consider the stakes and magnitude of transactions processed. Your customers are often making the biggest purchase of their lives and if you can position yourself as someone who not only recognizes that, but honors it, you’re much more likely to win their trust and their business.</p>
<h2>How to stand out in the crowded real estate space</h2>
<p>First, let’s address some hard truths:</p>
<ol>
<li>The real estate market is massively saturated and, no matter how hot your market may be, the competition is diluting your inventory of buyers and sellers.</li>
<li>Clients can have a hard time trusting agents.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you acknowledge these truths, you can immediately begin to identify and implement ways to stand out. On the bright side, the solution to these truths is often the same: Differentiate your brand by offering value, which builds trust and converts more leads.</p>
<p>This article is about how to position your real estate business – i.e., your brand – in your market so 1) you get found, 2) you offer value, and 3) you earn the trust of your leads so that 4) you close more business.</p>
<h3>Get Found</h3>
<p>To be found, you need to be present in the digital world. Do you have a website? A blog? Social media accounts? Is your voice consistent across all touchpoints? This is the only area of your business where you are 100% in control of the information and messaging available to the public.</p>
<p>Take a few minutes to review your professional site and social profiles to make sure 1) you’re accessible and 2) your messaging is consistent and professional.</p>
<p><u>Website</u>: The number one thing driving consumers to your site should be local listings. If you have a <a href="http://www.marketleader.com/products/professional-for-agents/">branded website with MLS listings</a>, a visitor should instantly be able to browse and search listings in their target area from your homepage.</p>
<p>When someone visits your website, they should immediately be able to learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where you’re located</li>
<li>That you list, market and sell real estate</li>
<li>How to contact you</li>
</ul>
<p>All this information should be displayed above the fold, which is the part of a website that is visible immediately upon visiting, without having to scroll.</p>
<div id="attachment_52621" style="width: 1254px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-52621" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-52621 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/website-above-fold.png" alt="Real estate website" width="1244" height="905" /><p id="caption-attachment-52621" class="wp-caption-text">Real estate website musts</p></div>
<p>Your website is a great way to attract and capture leads searching for listings in your target area, but you could also be attracting leads through content on your blog and engagement on social media.</p>
<p><u>Blog</u>: This is where you can share information specific to your industry, market, community, and clients. How much you invest in creating and maintaining an active blog is completely up to you, but the more information you have posted here, the more likely you are to be found in searches and attract buyers and sellers in your area.</p>
<p><u>Social Media</u>: Social is unique in that it is a two-way conduit for engaging with people and generating leads. It is the only digital channel in which you can listen to and engage your network. We’ll touch on that in a bit but be sure everything on your social profiles reflect your website, from posts to profile pictures.</p>
<h3>Offer Value</h3>
<p>Up to 90% of today’s buyer’s journey is self-guided, meaning customers are researching options, products, and businesses (read: YOU) on their own before they ever become a lead.</p>
<p>To stand out, agents need to offer value to their clients (past and future), and this often comes in the form of content that is published on your blog, which lives on your website, and can be shared through your social profiles. Do you see where this is going?</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/content-marketing-goals/">copyblogger</a>, content should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build trust and rapport with your audience</li>
<li>Attract new prospects</li>
<li>Provide solutions to clients&#8217; problems</li>
<li>Build strategic partnerships</li>
<li>Deepen loyalty with existing clients (read: <em>referrals and repeat business</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Sounds good, right?</p>
<p>Some ideas for content include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Community News and Resources – This will help increase visibility when potential leads are researching specific neighborhoods and, in highlighting local businesses, you’ll develop relationships with local business owners which can lead to more exposure and referrals.
<ul>
<li>Local schools</li>
<li>Food &amp; dining</li>
<li>Local vendors &amp; contractors</li>
<li>Local events</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Local Market Reports</li>
<li>FAQ’s about the process of buying/selling a home – Tip: If you can tailor this to your Farm, even better.</li>
<li>Lifestyle
<ul>
<li>DIY’s</li>
<li>Recipes</li>
<li>Decor</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Earn Trust</h3>
<p>Trust is the filter through which all successful business must pass. Whatever you decide to share, a little bit of carefully crafted content that offers value will go a long way in increasing your visibility and earning the trust of leads.</p>
<p>In addition to offering value through content, you can earn the trust of your leads by listening to and engaging with them on social media. Social listening is the act of searching posts by topic and location on social media channels &#8211; you can then join conversations, meet and engage with people in a way that is both personal and valuable. Be mindful: this is an opportunity to earn trust through meaningful interactions (answer questions, offer insights and commentary on topics relevant to your Farm &#8211; show off your expertise and offer value in every interaction).</p>
<p>Per the <a href="http://www.hutrust.com">HuTrust</a> model, “Trust drives 75% of client decisions,” and if a client trusts you, 82% of them will recommend you to others.</p>
<h3>Convert More Business</h3>
<p>Real estate agents who view their business and personal brand interchangeably recognize the need to differentiate themselves from other agents. Surprisingly, as crowded as the real estate industry is, there isn’t much competition when it comes to intentional branding and original content. Investing a small amount of time now to position yourself in any real estate market is a sure-fire way to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stand out from the crowd</li>
<li>Attract and capture leads organically</li>
<li>Earn the trust of past and future clients</li>
<li>Generate more referrals</li>
<li>Convert more leads</li>
<li>Be more profitable</li>
</ul>
<p>Market Leader Professional is an all-in-one software solution that helps agents attract, capture, and convert more leads. It includes a branded website with MLS listings that is extensively customizable. <a href="http://www.marketleader.com/products/professional-for-agents/">Learn more about Market Leader Professional.</a></p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/realestatebusiness/">Real Estate Agent: You’re not a Businessman.
