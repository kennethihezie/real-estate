										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are two ways to approach this.</p>
<p>You could create a real estate business plan to avoid failure. Many agents go that route and find some level of success. There’s nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p>But there’s another way. You could create a business plan, not just because it reduces the risk of failure, but because it maximizes your growth potential.</p>
<p>What follows is an invitation to do just that – to go through the process of refining intentionality, elevating accountability, and igniting motivation so you can be more productive. Year after year.</p>
<p>What if 2023 was the year you generated more leads and closed more deals than ever before? It’s possible. But only if you have a plan to follow.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">The Real Estate Business Plan Checklist</h2>
<p>To provide the big-picture view, here are the action items you’ll need to include in your plan for this year:</p>
<ul class="BlogUL">
<li class="BlogLI">Note learnings from 2022</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Calculate your expenses</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Set goals</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Create a marketing plan</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Develop a system for tracking your progress</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re going to take a close look at each. But if you want to hop on the fast track, download the <a href="#download">2023 Real Estate Business Plan</a> and you can get started right away. This free, interactive guide from Market Leader covers everything on that checklist and more. Plus, you’ll get downloadable templates for calculating expenses, setting goals, planning your marketing, and tracking progress.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">5 Year-End Reflection Questions To Consider</h2>
<p>Sometimes you have to look back before you can move forward. Use the questions below as a way to reflect on last year’s performance so you can identify your business’s strengths, weaknesses, and potential.</p>
<ol class="BlogOL">
<li class="BlogLI">Which aspects of my real estate business <strong>occupied most of my time and attention</strong> last year?</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Which aspects of my business <strong>performed best</strong> last year? (For example, maybe you received many referrals, responded quickly to leads, or executed a strong social media campaign.)</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Based on last year’s performance, which aspects of my business <strong>are most in need of improvement</strong>?</li>
<li class="BlogLI">What are the <strong>top two or three mistakes</strong> I made last year that I need to learn from for 2023?</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>What would “success” look like</strong> specifically for my business in 2023?</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Calculate Your Expenses</h2>
<p>Believe it or not, tracking your expenses is an important prerequisite to maximizing your gross commission income for 2023. If you have the right expense-tracking system in place, you’ll get more of your hard-earned income back at the end of the year.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to track all of your deductible business expenses. You may be surprised to learn about the <a href="https://outfront.kw.com/training/11-tax-deductions-every-real-estate-agent-should-know-about/">many ways you can reduce the amount you owe to the IRS</a>. For example, you might even be eligible to deduct expenses related to software, marketing, advertising, and lead generation. Refer to <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p535.pdf">IRS Publication 535</a> for details and be sure to consult with your CPA or financial advisor so you don’t miss out on any money-saving tips.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Two of the Best Ways to Track Your Expenses</h3>
<ul class="BlogUL">
<li class="BlogLI">Use an app. There are many free and low-cost options that allow you to categorize and track your expenses on the go. For example, check out <a href="https://www.spendee.com/">Spendee</a> or <a href="https://dollarbird.co/">Dollarbird</a>. They’re both simple and user-friendly, and they both have options to get you started for less than $5 per month.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Download the free “Expense Tracker” template in Market Leader’s <a href="#download">2023 Real Estate Business Plan</a>. It provides space for you to calculate your personal living expenses and all of your various business expenses all in one place.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Set Your Real Estate Business Goals</h2>
<p>Start by <strong>identifying your average commission per transaction</strong>. Multiply the <a href="https://www.realtor.com/research/market-trends/">median listing price in your area</a> by your commission percentage rate.</p>
<p>Once you’ve calculated your expenses and you’ve figured out roughly how much you’ll bring in from each transaction, you’ll be informed enough to establish an <strong>attainable income goal for 2023</strong>.</p>
<p>From there you can determine how many transactions you’ll need for the year.</p>
<p>The Formula: A ÷ B = C</p>
<p>A. Your 2023 Income Goal<br />
B. Estimated Commission Per Transaction<br />
C. Transactions Needed for the Year</p>
<p>To drill down even farther, check out Market Leader’s free <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/leadcalculator/">Lead Calculator</a>. Simply punch in the numbers you’re aiming for, and the calculator will tell you how many transactions and leads you’ll need across all lead sources to reach your income goal.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Create a Marketing Plan</h2>
<p>Maybe you’re on your way to “top-performer” status, but you don’t have a great plan for getting more clients and increasing your gross commission income. Or maybe you have a plan, but it’s not working.</p>
<p>Either way, you’ll benefit from learning how to <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/real-estate-marketing-plan/">craft a well-developed real estate marketing plan</a> that’s specifically designed to help you <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/products/real-estate-leads/">generate more leads</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick outline sketch of what that would look like in practical terms.</p>
<ul class="BlogUL">
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Build your brand.</strong> Establish a brand identity that includes a mission statement, vision statement, and a value proposition.</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Define your target market.</strong> You can’t be everything to everyone. If you try, your brand will end up blending in instead of standing out. So take the time to identify who fits within your audience.</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Collect data.</strong> When you’re armed with statistics, analytics, and insights, you’re better able to set goals, track progress, and make your success repeatable. Without data, your marketing efforts are more likely to be a complete gamble, if not a guessing game.</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Get marketing automation tools.</strong> With <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/products/professional-for-agents/">Market Leader Professional</a>, for example, you get a customizable, lead-generating website and a fully integrated CRM. Plus, you can automate new listing alerts and even create newsletters and content pieces like postcards, flyers, and video-enabled mobile-responsive emails.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Track Your Progress</h2>
<p>Why is performance-tracking necessary?</p>
<ul class="BlogUL">
<li class="BlogLI">It’s a way of <strong>holding yourself accountable</strong> to the goals you set.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">It provides you with the <strong>feedback</strong> you need to make strategic adjustments.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">It enables you to create <strong>new benchmarks</strong> for future goals.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">It takes the guesswork out of your <strong>professional self-reflection</strong>.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">It’s the most efficient way to <strong>spot what’s working well and what needs improvement</strong>.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">It helps you <strong>prioritize</strong> and keeps you focused on what matters most.</li>
</ul>
<p>It doesn’t have to be time-consuming and complicated. It can be as easy as creating a basic table in your favorite word processor or spreadsheet software, writing down all of your goals in the left column, and using the rest of the columns to note your performance each month (or week).</p>

<p>Still not sure if you’re ready to take the first step? That’s okay. To give you an idea of what to expect, here’s a sketch of some of the concepts covered in the full guide.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">What Is a Real Estate Marketing Plan?</h2>
<p>A real estate marketing plan is an organized collection of strategies, systems, and schedules that individual agents, teams, and brokerages use to guide their marketing efforts.</p>
<p>Every marketing plan for real estate must incorporate the five essential components listed below.</p>
<p>Which (if any) do you already have in place?</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">A Brand Structure</h3>
<p>If you have a weak brand, you’re more likely to lose focus, disappear in the crowd of competition, and misrepresent who you are as an agent. All of which reduces productivity and hinders your ability to acquire and retain quality leads.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH3">Data &amp; Analytics</h2>
<p>When you’re armed with statistics, analytics, and insights, you’re better able to set goals, track progress, and make your success repeatable. Without data, your marketing efforts are more likely to be a complete gamble, if not a guessing game.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">An Understanding of Consumers’ New Expectations</h3>
<p>Service providers of all kinds are constantly adjusting the way they do business to keep up with changes in technology, tactics, and trends. Are you aware of what prospects and clients expect of you as a real estate agent? If not, you risk falling to the background.</p>
<p>For example, most of today’s consumers expect prompt communication via text message. In a <a href="https://cdn.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/2022-home-buyers-and-sellers-generational-trends-03-23-2022.pdf">2022 report from the National Association of Realtors</a> (NAR), 71% of buyers said it was “important” to receive property information and communication from their agent via text message. Whereas in <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/reports/2015/2015-home-buyer-and-seller-generational-trends-2015-03-11.pdf">2015</a> – just seven years earlier – that figure was only 45%.</p>
<p>Consumers expectations change fast, and you need to keep up.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Social Proof</h3>
<p>Speaking of what consumers want, near the top of the list is authentic proof of your competency, especially in the form of reviews and testimonials. In what ways could you add social proof to your marketing efforts? Common ways for agents include requesting reviews on their Facebook pages or Zillow profiles.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Technology &amp; Tools</h3>
<p>The best real estate marketing plans include a social media strategy, video content, <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/solutions/marketing-automation/">robust marketing automation tools</a>, a <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/solutions/customizable-websites/">customizable real estate website</a>, and a <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/solutions/crm/">fully-integrated CRM</a>. But of course, merely having the right tools won’t be enough. You have to know how to use them.</p>
<p>Learn how. <a style="font-weight: 800;" href="#download">Download our free “2023 Real Estate Marketing Plan”</a> and make today the day you begin taking your business to the next level.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Only SMART Goals Will Produce the Results You Want</h2>
<p>Goal-setting is a crucial part of marketing for real estate agents. And maybe you’ve already established goals, but you’re not seeing the results you want.</p>
<p>The reason may be that they’re not SMART goals: smart, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound.</p>
<p>This approach enables you to set realistic goals while also increasing the likelihood that you’ll actually achieve them.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">3 Examples of SMART Goals</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>“I will increase the average number of leads I generate every month by 20 percent by the end of 2023.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I will attend one webinar or download one guide about lead generation best practices every month throughout 2023.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I will 1) research which real estate website provider has the best websites for generating leads and 2) implement a new website from that provider by the end of the first quarter.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Want a full breakdown of each part of the acronym so you can start setting results-producing goals today? <a style="font-weight: 800;" href="#download">Get our free interactive marketing planning guide.</a></p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">5 Must-Have Real Estate Marketing Strategies</h2>
<p>Goals are worthless if you don’t have specific strategies in place to help you reach them. Think of them as the difference between planning and wishful thinking. They are the “how” to your “what.”</p>
<p>It would be impossible to list <em>all</em> of the many strategies you could implement as part of your marketing plan. Plus, it wouldn’t be very helpful for you to skim through a dizzying array of possibilities. Instead, let’s narrow it down to five real estate marketing ideas that are sure to generate more leads.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Invest in Advertising</h3>
<p>In the <a style="font-weight: 800;" href="#download">“2023 Real Estate Marketing Plan,”</a> not only will you get practical pro tips for advertising, but you’ll also get a customizable budgeting calendar so you can put money where your <em>month</em> is.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Develop a Strategy for Referrals</h3>
<p>Imagine if every one of your former clients referred someone to you every year. That’s totally conceivable, and the success would be compounding – and life-changing! The guide gives you three ideas to jumpstart your referral strategy brainstorming session.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Use Marketing Automation Tools</h3>
<p>The best marketing automation tools do it all. With <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/products/professional-for-agents/">Market Leader Professional</a>, for example, you get a customizable, lead-generating website; a fully-integrated CRM; and the ability to automate new listing alerts, newsletters, and print and digital content pieces like postcards, flyers, and video-enabled mobile-responsive emails.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Leverage the Power of Social Media</h3>
<p>To give you a shortcut for implementing an efficient and productive social media strategy, the <a style="font-weight: 800;" href="#download">“2023 Real Estate Marketing Plan”</a> provides a handy “Social Media Cheat Sheet” so you’ll know the audience, tone, and user intentions applicable for each channel.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Get Exclusive Buyer &amp; Seller Leads Delivered to You Each Month</h3>
<p>Securing a steady stream of exclusive online leads each month cuts down on the time you have to spend on prospecting, while also putting you in a better position to plan for the future. For example, Market Leader offers <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/products/real-estate-leads/">real estate leads</a> which will empower you to reach your sales goals and sidestep the stressful boom-and-bust cycle.</p>
<h2 id="download" class="BlogH2">What Else Is Included in the Guide?</h2>
<p>In addition to all that we alluded to above, the “2023 Real Estate Marketing Plan” also provides the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information about how to build your brand, including your unique value proposition, mission statement, vision statement, and target audience</li>
<li>The “Marketing Audit” worksheet</li>
<li>The “SWOT Analysis” worksheet</li>
<li>The “Digital Marketing Toolkit”</li>
<li>And most importantly, the “Create Your Marketing Plan” worksheet where you can pull it all together to craft a comprehensive, actionable, results-oriented plan of your own to generate more leads than ever before</li>
</ul>
<p>Every big plan starts with a small decision. Will you download Market Leader’s free interactive real estate marketing plan?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Remember when you had a boss? He or she was the one stuck with the strategic parts of the business –  like revisiting and tweaking the business plan and creating an annual marketing plan.</p>
<p>In case you haven’t noticed, you no longer have a boss. So, the strategic stuff is waiting on you.</p>
<p><em><strong>Wait – I’ll need a business plan AND a marketing plan?</strong></em></p>
<p>Yup.</p>
<p>And, like your business plan, your real estate marketing plan is akin to a road map to effective business promotion. With it, you’ll have a strategy to market your real estate business to attract new real estate leads and retain past real estate clients.</p>
<p>So, what are you waiting for? Let’s get cracking on the essentials of your 2019 marketing plan.</p>
<h2>1. Set a budget</h2>
<p>Hopefully, you created a marketing budget as part of your 2019 real estate business plan. If not, do this first. Unless you spend all of your commission checks on personal “stuff,” you’ll need a clear understanding of how much money you’ll reinvest in your business.</p>
<p>The rest of the plan will depend on how much money you have to spend.</p>
<h2>2. Who will you target?</h2>
<p>All marketers determine their target audience before deciding on a plan and you will too, right? And, no, your target audience isn’t “all real estate consumers.”</p>
<p>Use last year’s client base to help you define who is most likely to be in your audience in 2019. Christina Garbedian, CEO of the social media marketing firm Social with Tina, suggests asking yourself the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are they local or from out of town?</li>
<li>What is the average age of your clients?</li>
<li>Are they primarily first-time buyers/sellers or repeat?</li>
<li>How did you originally connect with them (cold calling, door-knocking, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Any other questions that will help you define your target audience will help you create a more efficient marketing plan.</p>
<h2>3. Fine-tune your UVP</h2>
<p>Also known as “your message,” what is your unique value proposition? What do you offer that may be more intriguing or of more value than other area agents? Why should they select you?</p>
<p>“If you don’t have a unique [value] proposition, you’re just another real estate agent,” according to Tom Ferry, who explains why you need a UVP and walks you through the process of coming up with one in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYuk9aMWRQ8">this video</a>.</p>
<p>Kevin Ward, agent and author of “<a href="https://yesmasters.clickfunnels.com/freebookofyes">The Book of Yes</a>,” believes that agents should focus on the “<em>value</em>” instead of the “unique” aspect in “Unique Value Proposition.”</p>
<p>“They’re not caring whether you’re different or not. What they’re caring about is are you going to deliver us a better result. So, don’t focus on being different, focus on what your clients really want, which is the value, which is the result,” he says in <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hS3EfvIR6UQ">Your UVP &#8211; Stop Trying to Be Different</a></em>.</p>
<p>If you do have a UVP, but it’s vague, fine-tune it so that it’s ready for next year’s real estate marketing materials.</p>
<h2>4. Choose the form</h2>
<p>What forms content are your marketing messages (and your budget) best suited to?</p>
<p>These include (but are not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>Newsletters</li>
<li>Blog posts</li>
<li>Video</li>
<li>Newspapers (either ads in the local paper or your own, real-estate branded paper)</li>
<li>Ebooks</li>
<li>Published books</li>
<li>Door hangers</li>
<li>Postcards</li>
<li>Letters</li>
<li>Case studies</li>
<li>Brochures</li>
</ul>
<h2> 5. Choose the channels</h2>
<p>There are so many ways to get your marketing message out so once you’ve narrowed down the forms, it’s time to choose which marketing channels you’ll use to distribute these messages.</p>
<p>The most popular for real estate agents are typically the least expensive (hey, we’re thrifty!). Of course, social media is popular, so decide where your target audience hangs out.</p>
<p>For instance, Facebook and LinkedIn are ideal if you’re looking at demographics. These are the two platforms whose users best fit the age of the average homebuyer and seller.</p>
<p>Then, there is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your website</li>
<li>Email</li>
<li>Snail mail</li>
<li>Door-knocking (yes, it can be used as a content distribution channel)</li>
<li>In-person</li>
<li>Television</li>
<li>Radio</li>
<li>Webinars</li>
<li>Podcasts</li>
<li>Telephone</li>
<li>Pay-per-click</li>
<li>Billboards</li>
</ul>
<h2>6. Create your marketing calendar</h2>
<p>Your marketing calendar should tell you which activities you will perform every month. Not only does this keep you consistently on your marketing track, but on budget as well.</p>
<p>Use the worksheets in our <a href="https://success.marketleader.com/2022marketingplan">Marketing Plan</a> to help create your calendar.</p>
<h2>7. Don’t let your marketing plan rule your life</h2>
<p>Although it’s a critical aspect of your real estate business, the activities called for in your marketing plan can take over your life.</p>
<p>If you haven’t yet done so, make 2019 the year you adopt <a href="/solutions/marketing-automation/">marketing automation</a>. It will not only release you from the tedium and time-sucking aspects of scheduling and tracking your marketing, it can take over the creation and even sending of your marketing materials.</p>
<p>Most important of all is that automation keeps your communications consistent. Nothing falls through the cracks.</p>
