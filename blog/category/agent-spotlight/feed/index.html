										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-35651" title="Kevin Meyer Realtor" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Kevin-Meyer-Realtor-200x300.jpg" alt="Bellevue Washington real estate agent Kevin Meyer is Market Leader's agent of the week - and a former Market Leader employee!" width="200" height="300" />If you’re a longtime Market Leader customer, the name <a href="http://www.youreastsidehome.com/">Kevin Meyer</a> may be familiar to you. Although he’s now a sales agent with Coldwell Banker in Bellevue, Wash., Meyer was once an ace account executive with us for two years before being promoted to team leader and, finally, sales manager.</p>
<p>After eight years of dealing with agents’ marketing needs, he decided to cross over and become a real estate agent himself.</p>
<p>It takes a bit of courage to quit a well-paying job to go into commission-based sales—even more so for an agent with a wife and newborn baby at home—but Meyer did it, and has come out happily on the other side.</p>
<p>Meyer was born in Columbus, Ohio, and is a self-described Buckeye fan. His family moved to the Kirkland, Wash., area when he was a small child, and there he has remained.</p>
<h2>Life Before Real Estate</h2>
<p>Meyer worked in sales for Qwest Communications (now CenturyLink) before joining Market Leader as an account executive. Entering the real estate industry had always been in the back of his mind.</p>
<p>“I’d already been drawn to real estate, even before I worked for Market Leader,” he recalled. “I’ve always had goals to build a portfolio of properties, and I’ve always kind of followed the market.”</p>
<p>“Once I started working at Market Leader, I was learning more about the industry,” he continued. “Talking with agents, I understood and realized the earning potential. My goals were to leave Market Leader and build a team of agents. I let them know my intentions, of course,” he concluded.</p>
<h2>Challenges for a New Agent</h2>
<p>Meyer is now in his third year in the real estate industry. We were curious to know what challenges he is facing at this point in his career.</p>
<p>“I thought I knew everything when I got into the business,” he began. “I had a list of 18 names. I was 100 percent confident that those people were going to be buying or selling a home from me, quickly. Every single day, I found myself erasing one of those names,” he recalled.</p>
<p>“Everything I thought I knew about real estate was completely wrong. It’s definitely a lot harder than I thought, and a lot different than I thought,” Meyer admitted.</p>
<p>His biggest overall challenge, however, has been in making the transition from employee to self-employed. “It’s really hard to not have anyone give you direction or tell you what to do. Figuring out what I was supposed to be doing was a challenge,” he said.</p>
<h2>Finding Clients</h2>
<p>Meyer figures that he closes 26 transactions a year, at just the three-year mark in his career. He credits both Market Leader and some tried-and-true prospecting techniques for his success.  In fact, the telephone is his best friend.</p>
<p>“A lot of agents are afraid of the phone—afraid of picking up the phone and calling somebody and being rejected. I’m not. I’ve been in phone sales since I was 18,” he said. “Somebody says ‘no,’ I move on to the next one until I find somebody that says ‘yes.’”</p>
<p>“The Market Leader system is great,” he continued. “I use it to attract clients and get people registered, so I have their contact information. Then I use the system to cultivate those relationships. I close a lot of deals through the leads I get from Market Leader.”</p>
<p>Meyer says that he frequently hears agents complain that online leads are “bad” leads. “Everybody complains about leads and how crummy they are from x, y, or z company. The problem isn’t the leads. It’s the agent. They think about them as leads that should be transacting right now. You have to cultivate online leads,” he explained.</p>
<h2>Life Beyond Real Estate</h2>
<p>Meyer has his practice and two toddlers running his life, so he doesn’t have a ton of extra time to follow his volunteer spirit. When the kids get a little older, he plans on making volunteerism a family affair by working with a cause that helps “kids and/or pets.” In what little spare time he does have, he and the family hit the closest park, ride bikes and generally spend as much time together as possible.</p>
<p>We asked Meyer what he enjoys most about his real estate career. “There are many things I enjoy and very little that I don’t,” he said. “The flexibility of my schedule that lets me be more involved with my family is a big deal for me.  From a client perspective, I absolutely love helping people achieve their goals.”</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/agent-spotlight-kevin-meyer-bellevue-wash/">Agent Spotlight: Kevin Meyer, Bellevue, Wash.</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-35341 alignright" title="Jasmine Blue Realtor" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Jasmine-Blue-real-estate-agent-300x300.jpg" alt="Jasmine Blue Lincoln, California real estate agent" width="240" height="240" />It’s easy to assume that all real estate agents’ business models are pretty much the same. Now, consider an agent who has spent the bulk of her career dealing with REO (real estate owned) properties. When she decides to make the switch to traditional residential real estate sales, the differences are striking.</p>
<p>Jasmine Blue, an agent with RNB Homes in Lincoln, Calif., is discovering this contrast as she winds up her first year in non-REO sales. “The biggest challenge for me is working with real people again,” she disclosed.</p>
<p>“I shifted from REO, which is very black and white, and you’re working with banks and not dealing with people so much, to short sales, where I still worked with banks, to cracking the traditional sales nut,” she explained. “It’s quite challenging for me.”</p>
<p>Blue grew up in the San Jose, Calif., area and moved to Lincoln as a teenager. “Cow Town,” she described it, laughing. It’s no longer really a cow town—in fact, Lincoln was described by the U.S. Census Bureau as the fastest growing city in the state back in 2011.</p>
<h2>Pre-Real Estate Enterprise</h2>
<p>Blue was a cook in a retirement community, and kicked around in the jewelry business for a time, before fate stepped in and steered her into the real estate industry.</p>
<p>One of her co-workers at the jewelry store was dating a member of a top-producing real estate team in the area. “I happened to pick up the phone one day and got to know him and he said ‘Do you want to get into real estate?’” she recalled. “I said ‘Sure, where do I sign up?’”</p>
<p>Blue started as an admin with an REO agent, where she was “doing property management, turning on utilities, kicking out tenants—all the fun stuff,” she said. That was seven years ago, when she was just 19 years old. Today, she has more than 2,000 distressed sales under her belt, and she and her partner oversee a team of seven.</p>
<h2>Building Blocks for Success</h2>
<p>When it comes to ramping up her traditional real estate practice, Blue believes that consistency is the key to success. “I think a lot of Realtors® look for that magic wand to make their business thrive, and it just comes down to being consistent and finishing your projects and sticking with something. What works best is what works for you,” she advised.</p>
<p>Blue primarily uses traditional marketing methods. “I do the standard stuff when I get a listing,” she said. “I go door knocking. I do the just-listeds. I call my database.”</p>
<p>She also uses Craigslist. We asked her about any challenges she faces with <a href="/blog/navigating-the-new-rules-of-craigslist/">the recent changes made to the listing service</a>. “You have to adapt to the Craigslist changes,” she said. “It’s definitely gone down in quality, but it still works and it’s a free tool to use.”</p>
<p>Blue was introduced to Market Leader products when she was with Keller Williams, and she decided to continue using them after she left the company. Her Market Leader website is what actually helps bring in new clients, she said.</p>
<p>“It works really well for lead capture,” she shared. “It’s definitely impacted me in a positive way. It probably accounts for 25 to 30 percent of my business, on the buyers side.”</p>
<h2>It’s Not All About Work</h2>
<p>Blue gives back to the community by volunteering with The Glass Slipper, an organization that works with girls who have experienced abuse. One feature of the organization is a mentorship program, and Blue uses her experience as a cook to help out as a mentor in the cooking program.</p>
<p>When she isn’t working or mentoring, Blue enjoys being outdoors, fishing and hiking. “Also, anything to do with wine, I’m definitely there,” she added.</p>
<p>In fact, when we asked her where she sees herself a decade from now, she said she’d like to open a winery. Will it include a café with Jasmine Blue cuisine? She laughed, “That will be at the top of my list.”</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/agent-spotlight-jasmine-blue-lincoln-calif/">Agent Spotlight: Jasmine Blue, Lincoln, Calif.</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-34571" title="Jon Ellen Snyder Realtor" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Jon-Ellen-Snyder-Realtor-214x300.jpg" alt="Jon Ellen Snyder, a real estate agent from Livingston, Montana" width="214" height="300" />Somewhere along the line, between the hospital and the Kalamazoo County clerk’s office, someone misspelled baby Jan Ellen’s name and she became Jon Ellen Snyder. Mom and Dad bore no hard feelings, however, and the family remained in Kalamazoo for Jon’s entire childhood.</p>
<p>From there, it was fashion school in Los Angeles followed by a career as a department manager for large department stores.</p>
<p>Snyder met her husband in Denver and they travelled the world for his job as an architect, living for a time in Pakistan, Chicago, London, and finally, Montana.</p>
<p>“We landed in Livingston, population 7,500,” she recalled. “Luckily, we had lived in Jackson Hole (Wyo.) before we moved here, which also has a very small local population, so I got a taste for living in a small town,” she continues.</p>
<p>“If I hadn’t had that taste I don’t know if we would’ve lasted here. But it’s a wonderful small town. It’s 50 miles from Yellowstone Park and we enjoy camping and outdoor activities. There’s a lot of beauty around here, plus the people are awesome. It’s not the typical small town.”</p>
<h2>From World Traveler to Small-Town Agent</h2>
<p>When the couple first got to Livingston, Snyder was doing secretarial work. “I enjoyed that job. Even to be a legal secretary in Livingston at the time, though, you were only making seven bucks an hour,” Snyder said. “I quickly learned that if you were going to make it in Montana you needed some sort of self-employment.”</p>
<p>“I happened to work with a woman who was doing a lot of real estate investing…and with my husband being an architect, I just thought, well, why not get my real estate license?”</p>
<p>That was 18 years ago, so at this point Snyder is a longtime Livingston local and knows her market very well.</p>
<h2>Challenges for an Industry Veteran</h2>
<p>When asked what kind of challenges she faces at the 18-year mark, Snyder shared that she struggles with finding the time for everything.</p>
<p><strong>“</strong>I think the biggest challenge for me is trying to find a work-life balance,” Snyder said. “Market Leader did <a href="/blog/the-happiest-agent-on-the-block/">that interesting survey</a> where it found that people that went into real estate because they wanted to make their own hours were the least happy,” she continued.</p>
<p>“When you’re a successful Realtor® you have flexibility, but you don’t make your own hours. If you are dedicated to your job and somebody wants to write a buy-sell at 9 p.m. on Sunday, and it’s Christmas, you’re going to do it. So, that’s why you have to look for a way to find balance in your life,” Snyder concluded.</p>
<h2>Marketing with Market Leader</h2>
<p>When Snyder started her real estate career in this small town, she didn’t know a soul. So, like most new entrepreneurs, she started throwing everything possible at the wall to see what would stick.</p>
<p>“I did things like joined the Rotary, I got on different boards, joined the Chamber of Commerce and did some newspaper advertising.  I also did a lot of direct mail,” she explains. “I looked for every place I could stick my face, really.”</p>
<p>Today, she relies on her Market Leader website for new leads and on past clients for referrals. She stays in touch with former clients with a drip email campaign that is so effective, she says, that 80 percent of her business comes from people she’s worked with over the past 18 years.</p>
<p>“I have the Market leader website, which has been great at bringing in new clients,” Snyder continues. “The thing that enticed me about Market Leader was before I had a website where I had to personally keep it up and that was a pain,” she said. “I also like that Market Leader has a mobile product and how easy it is to put people on drip campaigns.”</p>
<p>“At first I was very leery about people having to sign up in order to continue to see information,” she said. “But they do it. I find that people who are super serious about wanting to buy a house will sign up.”</p>
<h2>Out of the Office, Into the Field (Literally)</h2>
<p>We asked Snyder what she likes best about being in real estate. “Probably what I did this morning,” she replied. “We drove up to the mountains to see a beautiful little cabin and we saw a moose along the way. All the wildflowers are out,” she said.</p>
<p>“The thing I enjoy most is when I’m out in the field showing property in this beautiful area. It’s the best part of my job.”</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/agent-spotlight-jon-ellen-snyder-livingston-mont/">Agent Spotlight: Jon Ellen Snyder, Livingston, Mont.</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-34411" title="Jo Ann Schlott Realtor" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Jo-Ann-Schlott-Realtor-200x300.jpg" alt="Jo Ann Schlott - Tucson, Arizona real estate agent with Tierra Antigua Realty" width="200" height="300" />Jo Ann Schlott spent her entire life living just outside of Detroit before she decided to follow the sunshine and move to Arizona. There, she settled into her life as a stay-at-home mom of three kids.</p>
<p>All was well, until her divorce in 1997. “I had to find a way to make a living at the ripe age of 40-something,” she recalls.</p>
<p>She worked briefly as a legal secretary for a real estate attorney when she came up with a plan to get her real estate license. That was 13 years ago, and though she’s spent time working with several national brokerages, she’s now found that a locally-owned boutique firm—Tierra Antigua—is the best fit for her.</p>
<p>Schlott has built up a large roster of past clients. She figures that those folks and referrals make up about 80 percent of her business. Even with that edge, she says her biggest challenge at the 13-year mark in her career is trying to get friends and acquaintances to remember that she’s a real estate agent.</p>
<p>“I had that happen recently,” she explained. “I just found out that an acquaintance got a divorce and he sold his house and bought another one, all within the last nine months.”</p>
<p>Because she gets so much business from past clients and referrals, Schlott is at a stage in her business where she doesn’t need to do a lot of marketing for new clients.</p>
<p>“I am mostly using Market Leader, social media and occasionally sending out just-listed and just-sold cards. I’m lazy. I don’t do a lot of marketing,” she said, laughing.</p>
<h2>The Market Leader Edge</h2>
<p>Schlott was introduced to Market Leader products during a brief stint with Keller Williams Realty. “I’ll tell you, Market Leader offers one of the best websites out there,” she said. “They also have the nicest people that work there; you can ask questions and watch webinars. They do their best to educate you on how to use the website.”</p>
<p>But it’s no magic bullet, she cautions. “You need to learn how to use the site and how to work the contacts,” she said.</p>
<h2>Just for Newbies</h2>
<p>The best advice Schlott received as a rookie was that there’s enough business for everyone. “You’re not in an adversarial position with other agents,” Schlott continues. “Some agents forget that,” she said. “Those agents are your associates, not your adversaries<strong>—</strong>they’re the ones who are going to sell your listings.”</p>
<p>She also wants to warn new agents that what they learn to pass the real estate exam has nothing to do with the day-to-day practice of real estate. Schlott suggests that new agents take any continuing education classes that come along, and she highly recommends the GRI classes. “The GRI classes taught me more about doing business than anything else. They were a really big help to me.”</p>
<h2>The Best Part of Working in Real Estate</h2>
<p>Schlott’s favorite aspect of her career is the ability to be an independent contractor. “I enjoy most that I am right now sitting in my own house, in my office, setting my own hours,” she explained. “I go to work by getting up in the morning, making some coffee and walking into my office.”</p>
<p>“I think it’s true of a lot of people in this business that we’re control freaks and we don’t always play well with others,” Schlott continued. “I would die in the typical office situation, I really would.”</p>
<h2>There <em>Is</em> Life Outside of Real Estate</h2>
<p>We asked Schlott what she enjoys doing when she isn’t working.</p>
<p>“I enjoy golfing, I enjoy travelling,” she replied. In fact, Schlott has her next trip planned: A two-week African safari.</p>
<p>Schlott see herself as semi-retired a decade from now. “Old Realtors® die hard,” she said. “I’m going to be 80 years old and still driving clients around. I’ll probably scare them and they’re going to offer to drive me around,” she said, laughing.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/agent-spotlight-jo-ann-schlott-tucson-ariz/">Agent Spotlight: Jo Ann Schlott, Tucson, Ariz.</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-32361" title="Agent Spotlight - Tammy Scheiter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Tammy-Scheiter-169x300.png" alt="Tammy Scheiter is a real estate agent with RE/MAX in Lake of the Ozarks, Missouri" width="169" height="300" />Imagine growing up in a resort area where life is centered on a 55,000-acre lake and you’ll get an idea of Tammy Scheiter’s childhood. Imagine selling lakefront homes and waterfront condos and you’ll have an idea of what her life is currently like.</p>
<p>Tammy Scheiter is a <a href="http://www.yourlaketeam.com/">RE/MAX agent</a> in a town where she’s spent her entire life. “I grew up living on the Lake of the Ozarks,” she begins. “My father was an excavator but we had a resort when I was younger. I was answering the phone and taking reservations when I was 10 and 11 years old, so I think that’s where the customer service thing came from.”</p>
<p>That “customer service thing” is something Scheiter excels at. Anyone that’s grown up in a resort town understands that tourists are both a blessing and a curse. Scheiter prefers to concentrate on the former. “We appreciated tourists – that’s how we all made our living, was off the tourists,” she explains. “Everything we had came directly or indirectly from tourists.”</p>
<h2>Before Real Estate</h2>
<p>Scheiter held a variety of jobs before finally settling in the real estate industry. She worked on a gas dock, in restaurants, in banking and as a dental assistant. It was while working in the dental field, at the age of 30, that she was diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer. Not one to dwell on anything unpleasant, she sums up the experience by telling us, “Fifteen years later and I’m still here.”</p>
<h2>The Big Decision</h2>
<p>When she was well enough to work, Scheiter found herself working at a local radio station, selling time. While straight commission sales always scared her, this job paid a small salary plus commission, so she feels it was the ideal job to get her gradually accustomed to not relying completely on a salary.</p>
<p>“I was getting more and more comfortable with that commission structure,” she recalls. By 2005 she was comfortable enough to make a break from the salaried world and took on real estate full time.</p>
<h2>Challenges at the 10-Year Mark</h2>
<p>Scheiter will celebrate a decade in the industry next year, and we were curious to know what kind of challenges she faces at this point in her career.</p>
<p>“This is a really tough year,” she said. “It’s a really tough market. This year I think I’ve shown more property than in any year I’ve been in real estate, and I have less to show for it. There’s a big discord between buyers and sellers right now and our inventory is really down. We’ve really had to change the dialog and how we present what’s in our market,” Sheiter concluded.</p>
<h2>The Second-Home Niche</h2>
<p>Scheiter estimates that 70 percent of her clients are second-home buyers. To reach these clients she relies heavily on the Internet. “We do a little bit of print, but 98 percent of our buyers start on the Internet, so we have to have a presence there. You can’t just be out there on the Internet, though, you also have to look good on the Internet,” she suggests.</p>
<h2>Scheiter and Market Leader</h2>
<p>We’re always curious how agents learn about Market Leader products, so we asked Scheiter what led her to us.</p>
<p>“I started looking for some different lead generating systems,” she recalls. She found Market Leader during her research, and after speaking with a representative she was sold.</p>
<p>“It was a significant investment, but it wasn’t something that, if it didn’t work, it would break me, so I signed up for six months,” she explained. “Then, all of a sudden, I had three or four transactions that closed just before the six months was up. I think it generated me 30 or 40 thousand dollars. So I kept with it, because it obviously works,” she said, laughing.</p>
<p>We asked Scheiter what she likes best about her Market Leader products. “All the automatic things that go out are really kind of cool because people tell me I’ve been sending them stuff,” she said. “The system sent them, but people thought it was me,” she said, laughing. “It gives me a different rapport on the first phone call. People feel like they know me a little and are more comfortable. You’re already on that level because of what the system is sending out,” Scheiter concludes.</p>
<h2>The Love of Real Estate</h2>
<p>Scheiter’s favorite part of going to work every day is showing houses. More important, she says, are her clients’ reactions when they find that just-right house. “I love it when I open the door and I know they’ve found <em>that</em> house – just seeing them light up is everything.”</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/agent-spotlight-tammy-scheiter-lake-of-the-ozarks-mo/">Agent Spotlight: Tammy Scheiter, Lake of the Ozarks, Mo.</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-31971" title="Agent Spotlight - Debbie King" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Debbie-2-210x300.jpg" alt="Debbie King is a real estate professional in New Port, North Carolina" width="210" height="300" />Retirement doesn’t come easy to some. After a lifetime of working as an administrative assistant, in direct sales and then in the real estate industry, <a href="http://www.searchcrystalcoasthomes.com">Debbie King</a>, of King Realty, assumed she’d retire by age 55. That momentous date has come and gone and she’s still at it, selling Crystal Coast homes in Newport, N.C.</p>
<h2>Real Estate – The Happiness Business</h2>
<p>It’s happiness that gets King up in the mornings and keeps her coming back every day. “When clients are happy with their purchase, just the smile on their face – that just sounds really dorky – but the fact that I have had a huge part in making them happy is so rewarding,” she explains. “I know that every morning when they wake up they’re going to be grateful that they got that house, and that’s truly it for me.”</p>
<p>King got her real estate license a decade ago and spent her initial years selling new homes with KB Homes. Today, she is the owner-operator of her own boutique brokerage.</p>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>Something happens to a real estate practice at the 10-year mark. A lot of it is good – like the repeat business that typically starts rolling in at this time. We asked King about some of the challenges she faces at the decade anniversary of her business. “There’s not a huge challenge,” she replied, “just lots of little bitty ones. My biggest challenge would probably be getting people qualified for loans.”</p>
<h2>Marketing</h2>
<p>King credits her Market Leader website as the key to her team’s success. “Without it, real estate would be pointless,” she said. “What we do with Market Leader has just been phenomenal.”</p>
<p>She became familiar with Market Leader accidentally. “I had a bad experience with another company. Somebody from Market Leader sales called in a moment of weakness and I said, ‘Sure, I’ll try it.’” She also says it’s the best business decision she has ever made.</p>
<h2>Off the Clock</h2>
<p>When King isn’t busy running a successful real estate brokerage you’ll find her in her own slice of heaven on earth. “We recently made a huge investment in our own backyard. We’ve pretty much got our own paradise there with an in-ground pool and everything we could want,” she explained.</p>
<p>“Honestly, we would never just take some time to pack up and leave for the weekend, but with our own little paradise right in the backyard, I can go out there for two hours in the morning and feel like I‘ve just come back from a vacation. Same thing in the afternoon – my flexible schedule lets me do that. That’s what I do when I’m not working – just enjoy life.”</p>
<h2>10 More Years</h2>
<p>We asked King where she sees herself in 10 years. Without hesitation she said, “Cozumel, on the beach,” laughing. She added, however, that she has a sneaking suspicion she’ll be doing real estate deals from that beach chair.</p>
<p>“I’m 59 years old and I had thought I’d be retired by 55,” King continued. “I think now that if I had retired I’d be one bored chick. I have my moments when I want to quit, but I have more where I say, ‘I just love it so much.’”</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/agent-spotlight-debbie-king-of-newport-nc/">Agent Spotlight: Debbie King of Newport, NC</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-28741" title="Agent Spotlight - Nancy Braun" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Nancy-Braun-300x273.jpg" alt="Nancy Braun is a real estate broker in Charlotte, North Carolina" width="300" height="273" />Real estate agents typically don’t start their working lives in the industry, but rather hail from a broad array of businesses. For some, like <a href="https://showcaserealty.net/">Nancy Braun</a>, Showcase Realty Charlotte’s broker/owner, real estate may be a third or even fourth career.</p>
<p>Braun was born in New York and attended Cornell University, where she received a degree in industrial and labor relations. She went on to SUNY Buffalo Law School from there and, upon graduation, entered the world of corporate law.</p>
<p>Act II finds Braun leaving that world behind and opening a restaurant in Buffalo. For five years, this chef/owner thrived in the culinary world. As so many stories go, however, when the economy tanked, so did Braun’s restaurant.</p>
<p>“I survived, but I didn’t make a living,” she recalled. “I didn’t see any future in it. It was a question of moving my restaurant or moving me, so I moved me,” she concluded. “I really don’t like the cold anyway,” she added, laughing.</p>
<h2>To Charlotte<span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span></h2>
<p>So where does one go to escape the frigid winters in Buffalo, N.Y.? About 650 miles south would do the trick, according to Braun.</p>
<p>“I didn’t really know much about Charlotte, but I heard it had a good economy, nice weather, nice people and that it would be open to newcomers. It lived up to all those dreams,” she said.</p>
<p>With the new location chosen, all that was needed was a career focus. “I didn’t know what I wanted to do,” she explained. “I applied to law jobs, and I was looking for a restaurant.” Her dad stepped in, however, and encouraged her to get into real estate.</p>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>We all have challenges at different points in our careers, and we wondered what Braun’s are at the almost-20-year mark.</p>
<p>“My biggest challenge is changing up how we do business &#8211; implementing change &#8211; and getting a different mindset for the staff and the agents,” Braun said. “The world is changing, so implementing new systems and programs &#8211; new ways of generating new business &#8211; and getting people to understand that the old school doesn’t really work today with the Internet world and the fast pace. Just adapting to change is probably my biggest challenge.”</p>
<p>As owner/broker of her own real estate firm, Braun has her hands full. She has 50 people depending on her, including staff, agents and independent contractors. Obtaining leads for her agents takes up a large chunk of time, as does hitting the pavement every day as an active sales agent.</p>
<h2>Marketing</h2>
<p>Braun uses a mix of marketing methods to get the word out about Showcase Realty, its agents and listings. “We have a weekly radio show on a major news channel. We do a lot of postcard mailings, and we have very good Internet exposure – a strong social media presence and blogs,” she explained.</p>
<p>The firm also uses an SEO coach. “She helps us with our SEO development and some of our Internet marketing initiatives,” Braun said. It was this coach that insisted the company go with a Market Leader site.</p>
<p>“We have over 5,000 leads in our Market Leader system and they’re all assigned to a drip system,” Braun said. “It works well. I like that you can individualize them. You can have a basic drip campaign and then you can implement your own stuff within that campaign. It’s also easy-to-use for the consumer.”</p>
<p>She gives her agents and staff a lot of credit for coming up with interesting marketing ideas. “I have a strong staff of very creative people, so that’s kind of fun. It’s a young and dynamic team of people, and I kind of give them a lot of freedom so they can grow and implement really cool marketing strategies.”</p>
<h2>Where’s Nancy?</h2>
<p>When she isn’t working you can find Braun with her two children, ages 8 and 9. “We had a big bake sale yesterday and we raised $104 for dogs and cats that are homeless,” she explained when we asked what sort of things the family enjoys doing. “It was my son’s idea and it was really special. I had to get up early in the morning and bake. Then we sat outside in our neighborhood and sold our baked goods and beverages, and it was really fun,” Braun continued.</p>
<p>“I like the fact that he did it for charity – that was the whole point. He wanted to do it for dogs and cats. He first came up with the idea of making money for animals and then he said, ‘Mommy, you’re going to do a bake sale,’” she said, laughing.</p>
<h2>Giving Back</h2>
<p>As much as Braun loves the real estate business and enjoys running her own brokerage, it was when we asked her about her community work that she got excited. The Boys and Girls Club of Greater Charlotte has a huge fan in Nancy Braun.</p>
<p>“I’m the chairperson of resource development, which means I’m in charge of all their fundraisers,” she explains. “They really save children’s lives; it’s not just a Band-Aid,” she continues. “Sixty percent of the kids in Boys and Girls Clubs say that it has saved their lives. It provides them with mentoring and love and support, and a place to go after school when they might not have anywhere else to go,” she continues.</p>
<p>“They have people that care about them. It makes a big difference to be cared about.”</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/agent-spotlight-nancy-braun-of-charlotte-nc/">Agent Spotlight: Nancy Braun of Charlotte, NC</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-27561" title="Agent Spotlight - Rick Hogue" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Rick-Hogue-273x300.jpg" alt="Rick Hogue is a real estate agent in Louisville, Kentucky" width="273" height="300" />If it’s true that people with a lot of interests are interesting people, then you’ll be fascinated by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rick-hogue-920940a/">Rick Hogue</a>, an agent in Louisville, Ky. We certainly are, and we’d love to share what we’ve learned about him and his growing real estate practice with Keller Williams.</p>
<p>Hogue is a native Kentuckian, and although he attended the University of Kentucky with an eye toward engineering, he ended up in the U.S. Marine Corps, where he remained for six years.</p>
<h2>The Path to Real Estate</h2>
<p>Hogue kicked around a bit after his discharge from the Marines and ended up in culinary school in Chicago and New York, where he studied to be a pastry chef and proceeded to “gain way too much weight,” he said, laughing.</p>
<p>In 1990 he met Holly, his current wife, and they started an advertising firm. &#8220;We did advertising set-up for companies and worked with corporations on their ad campaigns and full color work,” he said. Most of the companies, such as McDonnell Douglas and Boeing, weren’t local, so the Hogues became one of the first ad companies to utilize file transfer protocol or email to submit proofs.</p>
<p>This experience put them on the leading edge of the World Wide Web, and they took advantage of the opportunity. “We developed websites for everyone from the federal government to a baseball team to banks and banking operations &#8211; we did back-ends for them,” Hogue explained. They also provided hosting. “Then, 2000 hit and we didn’t know it, but we were already out of business,” he continued.</p>
<p>“When the technology bubble burst, people that we had been charging a large amount of money for hosting could all of a sudden get that same hosting for almost nothing,” he recalled. “We lasted until about 2007 when I finally looked at my wife and said, ‘Hey, I haven’t been getting a paycheck for a while &#8211; I’m going to go do something else.’”</p>
<p>So in December of 2008, with a brand new real estate license, Hogue joined Keller Williams Louisville East, and he’s been with them ever since.</p>
<h2>It’s About Time</h2>
<p>Every business has its challenges. They never go away, but evolve over time. We asked Hogue what he’s facing at the six-year mark in his career.</p>
<p>“Right now my biggest challenge is time management, more than anything else. I want it done now and I want it done my way,” he said, laughing. “Time is my nemesis.” He is finally at that point many agents get to when they decide they need help, and 2014 is the year he plans on putting together a team.</p>
<h2>Marketing the Hogue Way</h2>
<p>Having practically cut his teeth on the Internet before the rest of us knew what it was, Hogue depends heavily on online marketing. “I have 27 websites and various blogs, along with my eEdge – which is the biggest one I market,” he explained. “We get roughly 9,000 people a month at that website.” He pushes the site through social media, Craigslist, blogs, and he even has the site’s URL on his car.</p>
<p>“We were averaging 200 to 300 signups a month at the site during its peak. Then Craigslist changed and we lost thousands of visitors every month,” he said. Last year, 38 percent of his business came from Craigslist.</p>
<h2>When He’s Not Working</h2>
<p>Hogue and his wife do a lot of charity work with the local zoo and 15Thousand Farmers, a group that teaches folks how to become sustainable backyard farmers and then provides them with everything they need to get started. “We donate rain barrels and other items every year.”</p>
<p>He also has a horse-crazy, 9-year-old granddaughter who gets a lot of his attention when he’s not working.</p>
<h2>Hogue and Market Leader</h2>
<p>We’re always interested in how our clients became involved with Market Leader and how our products have impacted their businesses. Hogue was using Top Producer when he first got into the business. “It was the tool of choice,” he claimed.</p>
<p>“It was a little clunky,” he continued, “so when Market Leader was first produced, I walked up to the booth at Family Reunion to see what they had. I took one look and told the guy I wanted to be an ambassador and wanted to go head over heels based just on what I saw,” Hogue said. “I dropped Top Producer within a week of when I took on eEdge.”</p>
<p>He’s glad he did, too. His first year in the business he did a respectable 15 transactions. Once he started using Market Leader products, he did 37 transactions. “Considering the average agent in Louisville does about six transactions a year, to me, 37 is good,” he said.</p>
<p>We asked Hogue about his most rewarding moments during a typical workweek. He didn’t hesitate before answering: “Smiling faces across the table when I hand them their keys.”</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/agent-spotlight-rick-hogue-of-louisville-ky/">Agent Spotlight: Rick Hogue of Louisville, Ky.</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-27281" title="Agent Spotlight - Cathy Daniel" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/CathyDanielPhoto080418-1-258x300.jpg" alt="Cathy Daniel is a real estate agent in Brentwood, California" width="258" height="300" />Cathy Daniel, an <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Cathy-Daniel-Realtor-543567616106309/">agent in Brentwood, Calif.</a>, had a childhood dream of becoming Party Barbie. With both parents in the real estate industry, however, her destiny ran more to Real Estate Barbie, or so said her first broker.</p>
<p>“I studied for my license in 1979 and got my first license in 1980. At the time I worked for Century 21 in Ontario, Calif., and I was so young and so naïve,” Daniel recalls. “The manager there told me that I was too young, too blonde and to come back when I was older.”</p>
<p>So, she did – eventually. First, Daniel worked in the grocery business, in a variety of positions. “I was kind of a jack of all trades in the grocery business. I actually loved it, but it’s not a very loyal business to people that wanted to be loyal to it,” she said. The union and employee problems eventually took their toll, and Daniel found herself in Northern California helping to open a Keller Williams office.</p>
<p>She sat once again for her real estate license exam and hasn’t looked back over the past 11 years. “Realty is such a part of who I am, my culture,” Daniel explained. “My mom and step dad are in the business. My stepdad is a commercial broker in Phoenix and my mom is a residential broker in Phoenix, and that’s all we talk about all the time; it’s all-consuming,” she concluded.</p>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>Daniel is raising her grandchildren, ages 6 and 8, so her biggest challenges revolve around running a business while simultaneously raising a family. “Starting over, being on call 24-7 &#8211; because you really are on call 24/7 &#8211; it takes a toll on your psyche, on your mental well-being,” she explains. “Right now, at this point in time, I consciously make an effort to not work as much. Yet, if I don’t work, I don’t get paid. So, right now, my biggest challenge is that I’m not getting paid because I’m not able to work as much.”</p>
<p>Lucky for Daniel, she found Market Leader about six years ago. Instead of hitting the pavement every day trying to drum up leads, she gets them from Market Leader, freeing up time for her to spend with the girls.</p>
<p>“About 99 percent of my business is from Market Leader,” Daniel said. “I don’t think I’d <em>be</em> in business without them.”</p>
<h2>Life Outside of Real Estate</h2>
<p>Daniel, a recipient of U.S. Congressional recognition for her work with veterans, always finds time to volunteer. She’s on the board of the Brentwood Police Activity League, is in the Rotary and participates in several other civic organizations.</p>
<p>“If you’re not volunteering in your community, you’re doing your neighborhood a disservice,” she said. “If I won Mega Millions tomorrow, I’d be a professional volunteer.”</p>
<p>Motherhood the second time around keeps Daniel busy, and the tug of war between family and work is challenging. “My biggest challenge is wrapping my head around the fact that I don’t have to be everything to everybody,” she explains. “In fact, my new favorite word is “next.”</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/agent-spotlight-cathy-daniel-of-brentwood-calif/">Agent Spotlight: Cathy Daniel of Brentwood, Calif.</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>
