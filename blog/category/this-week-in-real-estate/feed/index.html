										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>More Homeowners Are Utilizing Home Equity</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-41681" title="home equity real estate" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/home-equity-real-estate-300x200.jpg" alt="as home prices rise, homeowners are using their home equity to finance purchases and remodels" width="300" height="200" />The housing bust, which triggered a recession and a massive nationwide dip in home equity, deprived many homeowners of tapping into their homes for cash.</p>
<p>But, with home prices now rising, more homeowners are relying on their home’s equity to pay for remodeling, debt consolidation, or buying expensive items, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2014/10/07/real_estate/home-equity-loans/index.html">according to CNN</a>. Financial services company Experian and consulting firm Oliver Wyman said home equity lines of credit increased 27 percent during the year ended June 30.</p>
<p>This is probably a sign that the housing market is on the mend. But just because there’s a bump in home equity lines of credit, that doesn’t mean that it’s the best option for a homeowner. Here are a few things for your clients to keep in mind before tapping into their homes for cash.</p>
<h3>1. Mortgage Rates</h3>
<p>Mortgage rates have been historically low for some time now. According to CoreLogic, nearly 9 million borrowers got 30-year fixed mortgages at or below 4 percent. But the sweet deals aren’t going to last forever. Rates are expected to rise soon. &#8220;We may be in for a more volatile period,&#8221; Keith Gumbinger of HSH.com, a mortgage information firm, told CNN. Next month, many of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s initiatives to keep rates low, are coming to an end, Gumbinger said.</p>
<p>If borrowers locked into very low rates in the past couple of years, a home equity loan could save them more than refinancing the mortgage through a cash-out refinance, CNN said. If they decide to refinance now, they might end up paying a rate that’s as high as a percentage point more than the original loan. Keep in mind that they will have to pay that rate for the entire balance on their loan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody who has a 3.5 percent first mortgage is not going to do a cash-out refinance at 5.5 percent unless they absolutely have to,&#8221; Greg McBride, senior financial analyst for BankRate.com told CNN.</p>
<h3>2. Borrowing Costs</h3>
<p>The price borrowers will pay to get a home equity loan or line of credit (HELOC) is far cheaper than refinancing, CNN said. Many lenders will ask them to go through the underwriting process and they will have to come up with money associated with it, such as inspection and attorney review fees.</p>
<p>They will also have to get a new title search and insurance. That itself could cost $1,000 or more. Tell your clients to factor in those costs and see if it makes sense in the long run.</p>
<h3>3. Borrowing Time</h3>
<p>Factor in the payment time and schedule. When borrowers make their first payment on the new loan it will be like starting over on a 30-year loan. But, if they choose a 15-year payment plan, it would cut down on the numbers of payments, but increase the amount due each month.</p>
<h3>4. Determine What the Money Is For</h3>
<p>The best reason for someone to take out a home equity loan is to have a positive impact on their financial situation, such as a renovation that would increase the home’s value in the long term, or to pay for a degree, which would increase earning power. It’s best not to unnecessarily dip into these loans for luxury spending, such as buying an expensive car or taking a costly vacation.</p>
<h3>5. Tax Breaks<strong></strong></h3>
<p>Like first mortgages, certain home equity loans and HELOCs are eligible for the home mortgage interest deduction, CNN said. Borrowers are eligible for deductions up to $100,000 of<strong> </strong>interest paid on a mortgage&#8217;s principal.</p>
<h2>Builders Offer Incentives to Boost Home Sales</h2>
<p>To lure in buyers, homebuilders in suburban Phoenix are offering incentives such as swimming pools, built in barbecues and subsidized mortgage rates, according to <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-10-07/homebuilders-offer-freebies-as-booming-u-s-markets-cool.html">Bloomberg</a>. In one community, a builder agreed to cover as much as $10,000 of a buyer’s closing costs, along with another incentive that the buyer chose.</p>
<p>It’s not just a Phoenix phenomenon. Similar trends have been noted in areas from Sacramento, Calif., to Orlando, Fla. With home sales slowing down due to sticker shock and government regulations to slash the maximum size for mortgages with low down payments, builders are left with few options but to woo reluctant buyers with sweet deals. New home sales nationwide have been unstable. Prices dropped in June, then rose in July and August.</p>
<p>“Phoenix is very slow, Sacramento is spotty,” John Burns, a housing consultant based in Irvine, Calif., told Bloomberg. “The investors came in and pushed prices a little too high. And then FHA rocked the new-home market really hard.”</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/this-week-in-real-estate-more-homeowners-tapping-equity-builders-in-some-markets-sweeten-deals/">This Week in Real Estate: More Homeowners Tapping Equity; Builders in Some Markets Sweeten Deals</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Home Prices Rise at Slowest Pace in Two Years</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-41251" title="U.S. home prices" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/home-prices-2-300x200.jpg" alt="U.S. home prices rose at their slowest rate in two years in July 2014, according to the Case-Shiller Index" width="300" height="200" />In the year ending in July, home prices in 20 American cities monitored by the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index increased. The not-so-good news: Prices rose at the slowest pace in almost two years, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-09-30/home-prices-in-u-s-rise-at-slowest-pace-in-almost-two-years">Bloomberg</a> reported. Tight credit rules and slower wage increases continue to dampen the prospects of price hikes and other gains for the housing market.</p>
<p>According to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index, home values in those 20 cities climbed 6.7 percent in July compared to a year-ago period. That’s the smallest annual gain since November 2012. Economists were expecting a 7.4 percent bump in the index, Bloomberg said. Nationwide, prices rose 5.6 percent, down from a 6.3 percent gain in the year ended June.</p>
<p>Another reason why prices are slowing down is because investors are retreating from the market. That could be a good sign for homebuyers. In the past, investors have crowded the market, driving up prices and gobbling up inventory, and leaving little room for homebuyers to find their dream home.</p>
<p>Many investors were cash buyers, which put them at an advantage over first-time buyers. With price growth slowing and a slight uptick in the labor market, many Americans who were on the fence may now join the homeownership wagon. But, there’s a lot to be done to keep the momentum going.</p>
<p>“In order to support further gains in home prices, you would need stronger housing demand, an improvement in the rate of household formation, and inventory levels to remain lean,” Michael Gapen, a senior economist for Barclays Capital Inc., told Bloomberg. “You will get all of this, it will just be at a moderate pace” since owners shouldn’t anticipate “8 to 10 percent out of your home forever,” he said.</p>
<p>Adjusted for seasonal variations, home prices in the 20-city index slipped 0.5 percent in July, compared to the prior month. That’s the worst performance since November 2011. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had expected the numbers to be unchanged. Unadjusted prices rose 0.6 percent.</p>
<p>Overall, out of the 20 cities monitored by the index, 19 registered year-over-year increases in home prices. With a 0.9 percent gain, Cleveland was the only city that maintained its year-over-year increase, whereas San Francisco took the biggest hit.</p>
<h2>U.S. Home Prices Are Slightly Undervalued</h2>
<p>The current deceleration of prices may worry some homeowners, but Trulia’s Chief Economist Jed Kolko determined that home prices nationally are actually 3 percent undervalued in the third quarter of 2014.</p>
<p>“In 2006 Q1, during the past decade’s housing bubble, home prices soared to 34% overvalued before dropping to 13% undervalued in 2012 Q1,” Kolko said. “One quarter ago (2014 Q2), prices looked 5% undervalued; one year ago (2013 Q3), prices looked 6% undervalued.”</p>
<p>Kolko’s statement was part of the latest Trulia Bubble Watch report. Bubble Watch calculates whether home prices are overvalued or undervalued relative to their fundamental value. It does so by comparing prices today with historical prices, incomes, and rents. When home prices are overvalued compared to fundamentals, the housing market approaches a bubble, and is at bigger risk of a price crash.</p>
<p>“Sharply rising prices aren’t necessarily a sign of a bubble. By definition, a bubble develops when prices look high relative to fundamentals,” Kolko said.</p>
<p>According to Kolko, three out of five Housing Barometer measures are approaching normal levels. But the two measures that connect housing to the broader economy are still struggling, he said. So the job market and housing market aren’t helping each other as much as they should.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/this-week-in-real-estate-home-prices-rise-at-slower-pace-many-homes-still-undervalued/">This Week in Real Estate: Home Prices Rise at Slower Pace; Many Homes Still Undervalued</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Sales of New Homes Surge to 6-Year High in August</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-40831" title="new home sales" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rising-new-home-sales-300x200.jpg" alt="New home sales surged in August 2014, which is good news for the real estate industry" width="300" height="200" />Another sign of changing times for housing comes from a new report released this week: According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, new home sales skyrocketed last month to the highest level since 2008. That’s an indication that consumer demand is soaring, and if that keeps up the construction market would also do well.</p>
<p>New home sales <a href="http://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/">jumped</a> 18 percent last month compared to the previous month, reaching a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 504,000. According to the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/u-s-new-home-sales-surge-18-in-august-1411567310">Wall Street Journal</a>, that’s the biggest month-over-month jump since 1992, and highest sales since May 2008.</p>
<p>Right now, only about a tenth of all sales represent new homes. But the bump is a positive sign. An earlier industry survey showed that builder optimism is at its highest level since 2005. Both of these items indicate that we could be seeing a lot of groundbreaking in the coming months. The ripple effects could also be felt by the overall economy, though some analysts are still cautious about being too optimistic.</p>
<p>&#8220;The leap in August sales would bode very well for starts if it is sustained,&#8221; Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist of MFR Inc., said in a note to clients, reported the Journal. &#8220;We definitely would like to see more data on the new home market before concluding that we are ratcheting up to a new level of activity.&#8221;</p>
<p>One reason for caution: New home sales are still selling at a slower pace compared to historical data. August’s new home sales increased 33 percent compared to a year-ago period, but typically new home sales were touching the million mark before the last recession, said the WSJ.</p>
<h2>Mortgage Applications Slide on Rate Increase</h2>
<p>The cautiousness on the part of industry analysts is not without reason. While a lot of good things are brewing in the housing market, there are still some worrisome indicators. Triggered by a rise in interest rates, mortgage applications fell last week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.</p>
<p>Applications for both refinancing and home purchases fell 4.1 percent in the week ended Sep. 19. Though mortgage rates for 30-year fixed loans averaged 4.39 percent, the highest since May.</p>
<p>The MBA&#8217;s seasonally-adjusted index of refinancing applications slipped 7 percent, while the measure for loan requests for homebuying was down just 0.3 percent, <a href="http://www.dailyfinance.com/2014/09/24/mortgage-applications-fall-rates-rise/">Daily Finance</a> reported.</p>
<h2>Mortgages Now Easier, Cheaper for Wealthy Home Buyers</h2>
<p>If you have well-off clients shopping around, this news should be encouraging to them, and could speed them up in the homebuying process. Wealthy buyers are now paying lower average rates on high value loans called jumbo mortgages. They are also paying smaller down payments, and in some cases, lenders are even waiving mortgage insurance, according to a CNN <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2014/09/21/real_estate/jumbo-mortgages-getting-cheaper/index.html">report.</a></p>
<p>Tom Wind, executive vice president of home lending for EverBank, told CNN that some lenders have slashed the required down payments on jumbo loans to as low 10 percent. They also require lower credit scores to qualify. In the past, borrowers needed squeaky clean credit, with scores above 700 to get qualified for these loans. Now, some lenders are lowering the bar to 650.</p>
<p>The trend of an easier lending process for wealthy borrowers has been going on for months. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, the average rate on jumbo loans of $417,000 or more was 4.24 percent last week. That’s slightly lower than the 4.36 percent borrowers are paying on conventional 30-year fixed loans. Over an extended period of time, that slight gap makes a huge difference.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/this-week-in-real-estate-new-home-sales-soar-mortgage-applications-fall/">This Week in Real Estate: New Home Sales Soar; Mortgage Applications Fall</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Foreclosures Slightly Up, but Experts Not Concerned</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-39981" title="foreclosures" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/foreclosures-300x199.jpg" alt="U.S. foreclosures rise for the first time in four years" width="300" height="199" />For the first time in four years, the number of foreclosure auctions inched up in August. But, housing analysts say it’s nothing to sweat about.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2014/09/11/real_estate/rise-in-foreclosures/index.html">CNN</a>, nearly 52,000 homes went under the bidding hammer in August.  That’s just a 1 percent increase compared to a year-ago period. But it is significant because it’s the first time since November 2010 that the numbers have gone up.</p>
<p>Daren Blomquist, a spokesman for RealtyTrac, the firm which tracked the numbers, said this by no means signals a disastrous return to the time when the mortgage market collapsed.</p>
<p>Foreclosures have single-handedly dealt the biggest blow to the housing market in recent times. The economic bust triggered a trend where many homeowners missed mortgage payments and lost homes to the foreclosure process. These distressed homes dotted the American landscape, dragging down prices in many neighborhoods.</p>
<p>This new rise in foreclosures has been attributed to delays in the process caused by the mismanagement of paperwork by some lenders, starting around 2010, who rushed in and caused what was called the “robo-signing” controversy. Many states came up with new regulations to safeguard the rights of borrowers.  The new laws put the brakes on many homes which were headed for auction earlier.</p>
<p>According to CNN, New Jersey alone has about 80,000 homes that are in trouble, but may not have yet received any default notices.</p>
<h2>Tell Your Clients to Now Think Inside the Box</h2>
<p>In uncertain economic times, consumers are always hunting for a good deal. The latest buzz in the affordable housing market was created by people who are thinking <em>inside</em> the box. They are making inexpensive homes out of old shipping containers.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-39961 alignleft" title="Quik House" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Quik-House-300x225.jpg" alt="Quik House shipping container house built by Quik Build LLC" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<p>After carrying goods across the ocean from far-off continents, these steel boxes often sit idle around American ports. Some creative architects have come to their rescue and are converting them into affordable guesthouses, studios and single-family homes, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2014/09/05/real_estate/shipping-container-costs/">according to CNN</a>.</p>
<p>Taking six shipping containers, Architect Adam Kalkin has designed a 2,000-square-foot home called <a href="http://www.quik-build.com/">Quik House</a>. Among other amenities, these two-story homes have three bedrooms, two and a half baths, a laundry room, a pantry and a mudroom.</p>
<p>The base price of a Quik House is $119,000, says the CNN report. That includes six modified containers with walls, windows, stairs and pre-fitted electric and plumbing.  However, it’s then on the buyer to procure the land where the house would sit, get building permits and have the home connected to water, sewer lines, gas and electric.  The typical cost of the process, including assembly, laying foundation, plumbing, heating, flooring and other utility work and finishes, comes to $184,000.</p>
<p>And the best part – besides the price and the fact that it takes only 10 weeks to be delivered – is that the home is eco-friendly, and your clients can opt to add on cool features such as a green roof or solar power system.</p>
<p>The space and size of the offering could fit the needs of many consumers, who dream of owning such a home, but are crunched for finances. Homebuyers are apparently rising to the occasion: There’s currently a six-month wait list for these homes, CNN said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Southern States Lead Most Affordable U.S. Housing Markets</h2>
<p>Buying a home is one of the most expensive investments most people will make in their lifetime. But, some buyers get away with a smaller price tag than others. The price of a home depends on a variety of factors, including location.</p>
<p>RealtyTrac calculated income-to-price affordability ratios for 2,270 counties across the country to determine the most affordable housing markets. Based on that data, residents of Chattooga County, Georgia, have the most affordable houses in the nation.</p>
<p>The good news for buyers is that a majority of the most affordable markets have become even more affordable in the last decade, according to <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2014/09/06/24-7-wall-st-affordable-housing-markets/15136003/">USA Today</a>. So now may the time to snag that good deal.</p>
<p>The five most affordable housing markets in America all fall in Southern states. They are: Chattooga County, Ga.; Lake County, Tenn.; Edgecombe County, N.C.; Upson County, Ga. and Barnwell County, S.C.</p>
<h2>Developers Racing to Build Condo Towers</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-39601" title="condo tower construction" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/condo-tower-construction-300x198.jpg" alt="U.S. builders constructing condo towers in increasing numbers" width="300" height="198" />If your clients like condo living and sweeping views, they are in luck. Builders these days are trying to attract deep-pocketed condo buyers with taller buildings.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2014/09/04/real_estate/builders-develop-sky-high-luxury-condo-buildings/index.html">CNN</a>, in Midtown Manhattan alone, four such sky-kissing towers are going up within blocks of each other.  Right now, the almost completed One57, at 1,005 feet, is New York’s tallest residential building.</p>
<p>But it won’t have that honor for too long. According to the CNN report, both 432 Park Avenue and 111 West 57th Street are expected to tower over One57 when they are completed.  Then in 2018, the Nordstrom Tower will open at 225 West 57th Street. Expected to stand at 1,775 feet (including its spire), it will be just one foot shorter than the new One World Trade Center.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s happening all over. I describe this as luxury real estate becoming the new global currency,&#8221; real estate appraiser Jonathan Miller of Miller Samuel told CNN.</p>
<p>Cities that struggle for space, such as Hong Kong, London, Chicago, San Francisco and New York, are sprouting towering condos, Brian O&#8217;Looney, an architect with Torti Gallas and Partners in Maryland, told CNN. Most available lots in cramped cities are small, thus buildings are growing taller and skinnier.</p>
<p>The demand for these skyscrapers is mostly being fueled by international buyers, big business houses, Chinese businessmen, hedge fund managers, and Russian oil billionaires, among others, who are looking for a place to invest – and a way to earn bragging rights.</p>
<p>&#8220;The taller it is, the more prestigious it is. People want trophy homes,&#8221; Eric Trump, executive vice president for Donald&#8217;s Trump&#8217;s Trump Organization, told CNN.</p>
<p>Another reason we are seeing taller, skinnier buildings is because new materials and engineering techniques have allowed developers to build higher without making residents seasick on windy nights, Timothy Johnson, an architect with NBBJ in New York and Chairman of the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, told CNN.</p>
<p>But, it’s not cheap or easy to erect these enormous buildings. Developers have to splurge even before breaking ground and deal with city regulations. High-rise condo builders also spend big on hiring skilled trade-union workers to erect these tall structures.</p>
<p>&#8220;These developers have to build at the very top of the luxury market,&#8221; said Miller. &#8220;That&#8217;s the only way the math works.&#8221;</p>
<p>It’s always units on upper floors that fetch the highest profits, as buyers are willing to shell out big bucks for the view, Johnson said. Two penthouses at One57 have fetched an eye-popping $90 million each. One at 432 Park is apparently priced at $95 million.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/this-week-in-real-estate-south-tops-most-affordable-housing-list-builders-construct-soaring-condo-towers/">This Week in Real Estate: South Tops Most Affordable Housing List; Builders Construct Soaring Condo Towers</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Chinese Buyers Are Making Way for Chinese Developers</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-39441" title="chinese home builders" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/chinese-home-builders-200x300.jpg" alt="More Chinese builders are entering the U.S. housing market due to a tougher domestic market back home" width="200" height="300" />For the past couple of years, Chinese investors have been flocking to the U.S. housing market and buying up thousands of homes – even helping the recovery of home prices in some areas.</p>
<p>After a successful run buying up affordable U.S. real estate, some Chinese nationals are now shifting their gaze into the home-building business. According to <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money">MSN Real Estate</a>, Chinese nationals are investing in some of the priciest parcels of land.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Chinese real estate market is very competitive, and the U.S. housing market is recovering and expanding rapidly, so for us as a company to invest a certain amount in the U.S. makes a lot of sense for us,&#8221; Tian Ming, chairman of Landsea, a China-based developer, told CNBC.</p>
<p>Landsea, which calls itself China&#8217;s &#8220;pre-eminent green builder,&#8221; is pouring $1 billion into the U.S. housing market, the report said. They are starting with three new developments, including a condominium project in the New York City area, townhouses in San Francisco and single-family homes in the Los Angeles area.</p>
<p>They are targeting both Chinese and American buyers. &#8220;Our primary customer is still here domestically in the U.S., but because of our background and who we are and our brand in China, we will get Chinese customers who will want to buy our homes,&#8221; Tian told CNBC through an interpreter.</p>
<p>According to American developer Lennar, who is working with Landsea, Chinese parents are racing to California especially, and investing in homes so their children can attend American high schools and universities.</p>
<p>The spike in interest from Chinese buyers couldn’t have come at a better time. Since the massive downturn, the housing industry has been looking for saviors. Chinese buyers have been a huge boon for the market, especially because they are buying up homes with cash.</p>
<p>&#8220;China&#8217;s investment is spiking now because there is a fear by many Chinese nationals that their capital is not secure in China itself, and so they are looking for other places to invest,&#8221; Ben Thypin, director of market analysis at Real Capital Analytics, told CNBC.</p>
<p>The numbers are pretty telling. According to Real Capital Analytics, Chinese developers invested close to $3 billion in U.S. commercial real estate in 2013. At the very least, they are expected to meet the same numbers this year.</p>
<h2>Mountain Vacation Homebuyers House Hunt in Autumn</h2>
<p>The beginning of the school year marks the end of the traditional homebuying season. But, it turns out, fall is actually the start of another type of buying season.</p>
<p>According to Jed Kolko, Trulia’s chief economist, there are a handful of local markets where autumn is actually the prime house-hunting season – mostly vacation areas that are in the mountains and forests.</p>
<p>Nationally, home searches slow down in the fall, especially near beaches. They take the biggest dip in Hawaii and Florida, where home searches fall 10 percent below the national average. But in the mountainous states of Vermont, Maine and Wyoming, search activity registers above the annual average in September and October. Real estate agents there are still busy meeting clients’ demands.</p>
<p>“Outside the largest metros, there are some smaller markets where autumn is prime house-hunting season,” Kolko wrote in his blog.</p>
<p>The 10 counties where search activity is highest in autumn, compared with the rest of the year, are all vacation areas, he said. Most of them are in mountain or forest areas, and several are near ski resorts, including Lincoln, N.M.; Teton, Wyo.; and Watauga, N.C.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/real-estate-news/">This Week in Real Estate: More Chinese Builders Entering U.S. Market; Buyers Fall for Vacation Homes</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

According to the Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index report released this week, home prices increased 8.1 percent compared to a year-ago period.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Home Prices Increase at Slower Pace</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-39211" title="increasing home prices" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/increasing-home-prices-300x207.jpg" alt="U.S. home prices increased year-over-year in 8.1% in June 2014" width="300" height="207" />In June, U.S. home prices rose at a slower pace, perhaps signaling a future price trend. According to the Standard &amp; Poor&#8217;s/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index report released this week, home prices increased 8.1 percent compared to a year-ago period. But, that rate is down from 9.4 percent the prior month. It’s also the smallest annual gain since December 2012, according to the <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2014/08/26/housing-market-seemingly-cooling-off/">Associated Press</a>.</p>
<p>This is good news for many first-time buyers, who may have found themselves on the fence because of soaring prices. Some buyers have also been anxious about another bubble.</p>
<p>Prices were making double-digit leaps in many cities in the country, scaring away buyers and making homes unaffordable. But the slowdown in prices indicates things might be returning to a sense of normalcy.</p>
<p>Price growth slumped in all 20 cities on the index. In Cleveland, home values went up only 0.8 percent. In Las Vegas, Phoenix, Miami and Tampa, Fla., prices are at least 33 percent below their housing bubble peaks, the AP reported.</p>
<p>Even in uber-expensive cities such as San Francisco, there are signs of a slowdown. Prices were up 12.9 percent in June, while back in April the annual growth rate was 18.4 percent.</p>
<p>Economists believe that the Federal Reserve will raise long-term interest rates as the market slowly returns to a normal pace. That, in turn, could make mortgage rates go up. Some believe a change in rates won’t make a dent on recovery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rising mortgage rates won&#8217;t send housing into a tailspin, but will further dampen price gains,&#8221; David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices told the AP.</p>
<h2>Foreclosures Plummet Again, for 18<sup>th</sup> Straight Month</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright  wp-image-39221" title="foreclosures" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/foreclosures-300x199.jpg" alt="U.S. foreclosures fell 21.1% year-over-year in July 2014" width="270" height="179" />U.S. foreclosures spiraled down in July, bringing in positive news for a housing market that took a massive beating during the real estate downturn.</p>
<p>According to a report, the foreclosure rate slid 21.2 percent from the same month last year, falling to 45,000 last month. That’s the 18th straight month showing at least a 20 percent year-over-year decline, according to CoreLogic, a firm that tracks data for the housing industry.</p>
<p>Completed foreclosures, which indicate the number of homes that have actually been foreclosed, were down 8.5 percent from June, another good sign.</p>
<p>&#8220;The stock of distressed debt continues to rapidly decline, especially in Western states,&#8221; Sam Khater, deputy chief economist at CoreLogic told <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/finance/216102-foreclosures-drop-sharply-in-july">The Hill.</a>&#8220;The number of seriously delinquent loans fell by more than 25 percent from the prior year in 10 states, and seven of those states were in the West.&#8221;</p>
<p>Foreclosures have been the biggest curse for the housing industry since the recession hit. Abandoned homes dragged down property values and prices all across the country, while also destroying credit and dashing dreams. There have been about 5.1 million completed foreclosures in the last six years.</p>
<p>As of last month, approximately 640,000 homes in the U.S. were in some stage of foreclosure, compared with 976,000 in July 2013 – a year-over-year decrease of 34.4 percent, The Hill reported.</p>
<p>This downward trend is a relief for all in the housing industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Based on current trends, the overall foreclosure inventory could trend down to as low as 500,000 homes by year-end, which is very positive news for the housing market,&#8221; Anand Nallathambi, president and CEO of CoreLogic told The Hill.</p>
<p>&#8220;In total, there are now 36 states with an inventory of foreclosed homes lower than the national rate of 1.7 percent.&#8221;</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/this-week-in-real-estate-foreclosures-plummet-home-price-gains-are-slowing-down/">This Week in Real Estate: Foreclosures Plummet; Home Price Gains Are Slowing Down</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Winter’s Chill on Housing Market Ends With Rise in Construction</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-38481" title="new home construction" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/new-home-construction-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" />This past winter was one the coldest in memory for most of the country. It also had a chilling effect on the housing market. Transactions slowed down, and so did building projects.</p>
<p>But the chilling effect seems to be thawing, according to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/20/business/for-home-depot-a-spring-rebound-and-a-better-year-ahead.html?_r=0">New York Times</a>, and even better days are around the corner for real estate. Here are some solid indicators why:</p>
<h3>1. U.S. Home Construction Is Building Speed</h3>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.commerce.gov/">Commerce Department</a>, home construction increased sharply in July. Housing starts were up nearly 16 percent compared to the previous month. Compared to a year-ago period, housing starts jumped 22 percent.</p>
<p>The South fared especially well and registered big gains in both single and multifamily construction. Overall, multifamily construction was strong across the nation.</p>
<p>In July, at an annual rate of 1.093 million units, housing starts recorded the highest reading <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/20/business/for-home-depot-a-spring-rebound-and-a-better-year-ahead.html?_r=0">since November</a>. Single family starts spiked 8.3 percent reached a rate of 656,000. The rate for multifamily housing was 423,000 – that’s the strongest showing since 2006.</p>
<p>It looks like there’s no sign of stopping: Last month, building permits, an indicator of future construction projects, jumped 8.1 percent compared to the prior month. Tom Showalter, chief analytics officer at Digital Risk, which provides mortgage services and risk analytics to lenders, said the economy has to continue to grow and job improvements are also crucial to keep the recovery momentum going in the market.</p>
<h3>2. Home Depot Sees a Strong Quarter</h3>
<p>With construction picking up, the fortunes of Home Depot are also on the rise, due to the improved housing market. America’s largest home improvement retailer saw an increase in sales for big-ticket products such as appliances, windows and water heaters. According to the New York Times article, the company reported a big increase among its large clients, too.</p>
<p>“We believe, in many ways, it’s because of housing, and the fact that housing, while not as robust as last year, continues to recover,” Carol B. Tomé, Home Depot’s chief financial officer, told the Times of the company’s strong results.</p>
<p>Home Depot reported earnings of $2.05 billion in the second quarter, or $1.52 a share. That’s up from $1.8 billion in the same quarter last year. Revenue jumped 5.7 percent to $23.81 billion, up from $22.52 billion last year.</p>
<p>Comparable store sales also jumped 6.4 percent in the U.S. The company’s shares increased 4 percent on Tuesday, following the result. Both the Home Depot and the U.S. construction numbers surpassed analysts’ expectations.</p>
<h2>All-Cash Deals Still Popular Among U.S. Homebuyers</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright  wp-image-38501" title="cash deals real estate" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/cash-deals-real-estate-300x205.jpg" alt="All cash deals are still popular among U.S. homebuyers" width="240" height="164" /></p>
<p>According to RealtyTrac, all-cash deals are still popular in U.S. real estate. In the second quarter, all-cash deals made up 38 percent of all home sales. Although down from 42 percent the previous quarter, that’s still a huge number.</p>
<p>What’s bringing the number down is that some investors are finding fewer deals in the market. It’s a circular trend. When the market was down and under, cash buyers descended to its rescue. But, as they competed against each other and individual buyers, they consumed much of the inventory. That led to increased demand and began driving up prices. In some places, property values have increased so much that even investors have started shying away.</p>
<p>That’s both good and bad news, Daren Blomquist, a spokesman for RealtyTrac, told CNNMoney. The good news is that first-time homebuyers may have a better chance, he said. The bad news is that some of them may be “priced out of the market.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Report Finds Local Mortgage Rates Vary Greatly</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-38251" title="local mortgage rates" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/local-mortgage-rates-300x273.jpg" alt="mortgage rates vary wildly from state to state - some states have higher interest rates than others" width="300" height="273" />Tell your clients, a stellar credit record isn’t the only factor determining what rate you get on your mortgage.</p>
<p>Where in the United States you buy the house can also have a dramatic affect on how much you pay on interest rates, according to a CNN <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2014/08/05/real_estate/state-mortgage-rates/index.html">story</a>.</p>
<p>Rhode Island buyers are the luckiest in that regard, according to a survey by loan information sites GoBankingRates and RateWatch. At 3.4 percent, Rhode Island borrowers paid about 0.35 percentage points below the national average. Nebraska residents paid an average of 4.1 percent on the mortgages, which is the highest rate in the country.</p>
<p>Although the difference may seem minimal, over the lifetime of a mortgage these seemingly-small interest rate differences add up. For example, a 30-year loan would cost a borrower $28,800 more in Nebraska than it would in Rhode Island, CNN said.</p>
<p>It may be surprising to many that mortgage rates aren’t more or less the same everywhere. Nationally, mortgage rates rise and fall with U.S. bond yields. But there are many other variables, such as property values, employment numbers and competition and risks that influence rates locally.</p>
<p>Here are several factors that affect local mortgage rates:</p>
<h3>Strength of the Local Economy</h3>
<p>If the local economy is struggling, chances are you will have more competitive rates. Lenders in those areas lower the rates to attract more customers. But, if your local economy is going gangbusters, then financial institutions can afford to bump rates as well.</p>
<h3>Local Home Prices</h3>
<p>If your clients are shopping for a cheaper deal in rates, tell them to look into areas where home prices are higher. According to CNN, lenders incur many fixed transaction costs and because it can be as expensive to process a $100,000 loan as a $300,000, lenders make up the difference by charging more on smaller loans.</p>
<h3>Local Average Credit Scores</h3>
<p>The average credit score in an area also determines interest rates. The lower the credit score, the higher the rates in that area.</p>
<h2>U.S. Foreclosures Have Fallen Dramatically Since June 2013</h2>
<p>The number of homes in the foreclosure process dropped by about one third in the year ending in June.</p>
<p>According to CoreLogic, a California-based analysis company, about 648,000 homes were in some stage of the foreclosure process in June. That’s significantly down from 998,000 a year ago. The share of homes with mortgages in the foreclosure process also came down to 1.7 percent compared to 2.5 percent a year ago.</p>
<p>“The number of state and local markets with persistent foreclosure problems is becoming fewer and farther between,” said Daren Blomquist, vice president at RealtyTrac told the Wall Street Journal. The three states with the largest drop in foreclosures compared to the same period last year are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arizona &#8211; 53.6 percent</li>
<li>Utah &#8211; 51.5 percent</li>
<li>Minnesota &#8211; 49.5 percent.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Homeowners Cautious in New York Suburbs</h2>
<p>After the huge spikes in home prices last year across New York suburbs, buyers are getting cautious and holding on to their purse strings.</p>
<p>The price tags on homes, however, did encourage a lot of sellers to put their homes in the market. Looks like the combination of buyer cautiousness and seller enthusiasm has had a direct impact on the market. According to the Wall Street Journal, sales across the region fell from last year&#8217;s strong pace, and prices have stopped climbing.</p>
<p>When compared to the previous year, single family home sales fell 12.1 percent in Westchester County during the peak spring selling season. Median prices inched up 0.8 percent.</p>
<p>The story was similar elsewhere. On Long Island, excluding the East End, sales dropped 6.3 percent. In New Jersey the median price of a home slipped 0.1 percent.</p>
<p>The drop in sales is actually good news, according to analysts interviewed by the WSJ. According to these analysts, it’s a sign that the market is becoming normal. So encourage your clients in these markets to invest now and not wait or prices might start shooting up again.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/this-week-in-real-estate-foreclosures-down-dramatically-mortgage-rates-vary-wildly-locally/">This Week in Real Estate: Foreclosures Down Dramatically, Mortgage Rates Vary Wildly Locally</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Time Is Right for Millennials to Buy Real Estate<strong></strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-37961 alignright" title="millennial homebuyer" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/millennial-homebuyer-200x300.jpg" alt="Millennial homebuyers - the time is right for millennials to buy real estate" width="200" height="300" />If you encounter any apprehensive first-time buyers, tell them that the time has come to end their wait and invest in the American dream of owning a home. According to a story in <a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/money/real-estate/2014/08/02/reasons-millennials-enter-housing-market-now/13436885/">The Tennessean</a>, now is a great time for millennials to enter the real estate market. Here are a few reasons why:</p>
<p><strong>1. Low Interest Rates</strong></p>
<p>Rates are still hovering near the bottom. That should help first-time clients find affordable homes. Despite recent hikes in rates, the average weekly rate for the 30-year fixed mortgage program is still below 4.5 percent, which is a historic low. There’s no guarantee that rates will stay that low, so encourage buyers to get into the market before rates go up and make it more difficult for them to buy.</p>
<p><strong>2. Down Payments Are Not a Barrier</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>The good news is you can still buy a home without investing 20 percent in a down payment. While many lenders are still scrutinizing credit histories closely and demanding higher down payments, other options exist for millennials and other first-time buyers. Encourage your clients to explore options such as the Federal Housing Administration’s loan program, which offers loans with down payments as low as 3.5 percent. Different states also have housing finance agencies that help first-time buyers. Some offer a lock on mortgage rates for a specific time period. Encourage your clients to explore all options.</p>
<p><strong>3. Homes Are Assets – Investments for the Future</strong></p>
<p>Remind your newbie clients that homes are an asset. Owning their own home rather than renting could help them build wealth. Rents are climbing steadily, and in many markets it’s cheaper to buy than to rent. According to The Tennessean article, Americans have more than $10.8 trillion of equity in their homes.</p>
<h2>U.S. Home Prices Rise at Average Monthly Rate</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-37971" title="increasing home prices" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/imcreasing-home-prices-300x207.jpg" alt="Home prices increased 0.8% in July 2014 from June 2014" width="300" height="207" />According to the <strong>Trulia Price Monitor and Trulia Rent Monitor</strong>, two early leading indicators for rents and asking prices, home prices rose 0.8 percent month-over-month in July. The increase was in line with the average monthly gain over the past year, settling back down after a 1.2% month-over-month in June, said Jed Kolko, Trulia’s chief economist, on the Trulia Trends blog.</p>
<p>Home prices aren’t rising as sharply as they were before, but home price increases are happening nationwide. The report notes that 97 of 100 metro areas posted year-over-year price gains, while 94 markets posted quarter-over-quarter gains.</p>
<p>That’s a sign that the market is on the right track, and that housing overall is stabilizing. For the first time in more than two years, none of the big U.S. housing markets experienced a year-over-year increase in home prices of more than 15 percent, Kolko said. Most of the price gains are happening in the Midwest and the South.</p>
<p>Kolko said local markets need to depend more on job growth to drive housing demand. That’s a more sustainable driver for the industry’s growth, he said.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/real-estate-news-a-good-time-for-millennial-buyers-home-prices-rise-at-average-pace/">Real Estate News: A Good Time for Millennial Buyers; Home Prices Rise at Average Pace</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>
