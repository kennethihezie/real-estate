										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Market Leader was delighted to attend the 2016 iteration of the Keller Williams Family Reunion. It was truly a pleasure to meet and talk with the thousands of KW associates who visited our booth over the course of this three-day event, held this year in festive New Orleans, LA. </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/KW-Family-Reunion-2016-associate.jpg" alt="An exceptional Keller Williams associate at the 2016 Family Reunion" width="200" height="267" class="alignright size-full wp-image-49715" />The Market Leader team always relishes the opportunity to chat in person with KW associates and get their feedback on the eEdge system, answer any questions they may have, and listen to success stories about how they’ve used it to build their businesses.</p>
<p>This Family Reunion also allowed our team to share the slew of powerful new features that were recently added to the eEdge system, as well as give a sneak peek at the features that will be added later this year.</p>
<p>This was a particularly special KW Family Reunion for Market Leader as it marked the five-year anniversary of the launch of eEdge. For half a decade now, KW associates have used eEdge’s lead-to-close business solution to manage and grow their businesses.</p>
<p>We marked this important occasion by giving away the most rocking giveaway we’ve ever seen &#8211; a one-of-a-kind Keller Williams-branded electric guitar! A hearty congratulations to the associate who won it, the marvelous Ashli Russell of Fresno, Calif. </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/KW-Family-Reunion-2016-giveaway-winners-2.jpg" alt="KW associate who won an iPad Mini from Market Leader at the 2016 Keller Williams Family Reunion" width="600" height="337" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-49717" /></p>
<p>However, Russell wasn’t the only lucky associate who visited our booth and won an awesome giveaway. Congratulations to Lesly Olavesen, Cheryl Huber, and Ambreen Alam for each winning an iPad Mini!</p>
<p>Thanks for joining Market Leader at the Keller Williams Family Reunion this year! We look forward to working hard with KW associates across the country in the coming year to make 2016 a success.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/feeling-at-home-at-the-2016-keller-williams-family-reunion/">Feeling at Home at the 2016 Keller Williams Family Reunion</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every year, there are more real estate industry conventions and conferences than any one agent can possibly attend. Then, there are the local networking events, such as chamber mixers and community events that can be used (subtly) to network. All of these events can quickly fill up a real estate agent’s calendar, so it’s important to decide which are worth your time, and let the other ones slide.</p>
<p>So, how to decide? It’s all about the takeaways. Think carefully about what’s valuable to you, and figure out which events you’ll get the most out of. Here are some ideas to help you make the most of your time.</p>
<h2>Industry Events</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-41491" title="real estate conferences and conventions" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/real-estate-conferences-and-conventions-300x200.jpg" alt="Are local and industry conferences and conventions worth real estate agents time?" width="300" height="200" />Although industry events such as conferences and conventions are fine for networking, especially if you specialize in relocation or are looking for referrals. They’re also ideal educational arenas. Deciding which ones to attend each year can be challenging. Ask yourself what part of your business needs the most attention. What area do you want to devote more time to in the coming year?</p>
<p>Maybe you’d like to beef up your website, take on video marketing, or become more mobile-marketing savvy. Some workshops at conventions and conferences are highly specific and specialized. The upcoming National Association of Realtors® <a href="http://www.realtor.org/convention.nsf/">Conference</a>, for instance, is offering a workshop on the use of drones in marketing.</p>
<p>Marketing your real estate business is an ongoing task. If you’re feeling stuck, the takeaways from a <a href="http://www.hearitdirect.com/events/">Hear it Direct</a> conference can be invaluable. These events allow agents to “hear the unfiltered voice of real estate consumers.” You’ll be amazed at the insights you will gain about buyers, sellers, Gen Y and other groups of clients as they speak their minds at these events. Events are held throughout the year, across the country. Use the takeaways to tweak your marketing efforts.</p>
<p>If you feel the need to learn more about the use of technology in your business, and about the latest gadgets, there’s a workshop or conference for that. Need to hone your negotiating skills? There’s one for that too.</p>
<p>Any event that advances your knowledge of the industry or amps up your efficiency is worth your time and money. An added bonus of attending industry events is that you’ll be able to share ideas and swap tips with other agents.</p>
<h2>Community Events</h2>
<p>Community events are used by agents more for networking than for education. Chamber mixers, civic club events, and even church socials are all ways to meet potential clients. Again, there are a seemingly endless number of community events, so you’ll need to decide which ones are the most important. That decision is a snap, if you follow issues you have passion for.</p>
<p>If you love working with animals, join an animal rescue group or volunteer at the ASPCA. A local Habitat for Humanity group could be a great fit for a real estate agent. Even running for a seat on your homeowners association board will get you exposed to potential clients.</p>
<p>Sometimes it helps to think of social issues that matter to you when deciding which group to join. Mothers Against Drunk Driving, a local breast cancer or AIDS agency, groups that work with underprivileged children or the homeless, for instance. Many agents become involved in civic groups such as the Lions Club, Jaycees, Rotary, Kiwanis or the Hispanic or Asian Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Any local event is potentially worth an agent’s time if it gets your name out to the community, or if it offers the opportunity to meet potential clients. Consider it part of your marketing efforts and actually schedule the time to attend these meetings and events.</p>
<p align="center">&#8212;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright  wp-image-33421" title="IanMorris-caption" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IanMorris-caption-230x300.png" alt="Ian Morris, President of Market Leader, at the Gathering of Eagles conference of real estate industry leaders" width="184" height="240" />Last week I travelled to Dallas to join over 370 leaders of the real estate industry at the annual Gathering of Eagles conference.</p>
<p>Sponsored by REAL Trends, the event is something I look forward to with great anticipation, but this year it was more amazing than I envisioned.</p>
<p>While REAL Trends sponsored the keynote speaker, former President George W. Bush, Trulia and Market Leader hosted a special, private session with him.</p>
<p>Whether the attendees agreed with President Bush’s politics or not, I think Steve Murray, president of REAL Trends and the moderator of the question-and-answer session, summed up how many of us felt after the session: “The President shared some deeply personal thoughts and convictions of what great leaders do when confronted with unexpected challenges.”</p>
<p>In a nutshell, the former president identified three things that effective leaders do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Surround themselves with the right advisors.</li>
<li>Benchmark all decisions around the mission or core values of the organization.</li>
<li>Be prepared to make the right decisions, even if they might not be popular.</li>
</ul>
<p>The key takeaway for me and several other attendees was how we can apply the former president’s leadership style to our individual circumstances.</p>
<h2>Making Decisions Based on Core Values</h2>
<p>Shortly after the election, President Bush very quickly figured out what was going to define his presidency. He walked in with an agenda – as any leader does – and he had a vision. This is a trait shared by all leaders: having a vision of where you want to take an organization, a department or, for real estate brokers or agents, where you want to take your office or your personal book of business.</p>
<p>Visions, however, can shift unexpectedly and you must rise to the occasion. President Bush pointed this out when he contrasted his original vision against the events of 9/11. His mission then became one of protecting the people of the United States. He became what he’d never envisioned: a wartime president. Adjusting the vision to the reality was a challenge, but one he rose to.</p>
<p>One of the most challenging aspects of the situation was determining a litmus test for making the huge decisions that were required of him.</p>
<p>For example, he talked about sitting in that third-grade classroom and finding out what was taking place on 9/11. From that moment forward, he based every single decision on core values, with the safety of the American people paramount among them.</p>
<p>I think this tactic can apply to business as well. If you’re just making decisions based on the situation, without benchmarking them against your (or the company’s) values, you run the very real risk of making a decision that is less than ideal.</p>
<p>While many of the decisions that confronted President Bush were far weightier than those we face at work, the former president explained that having this benchmark made decision-making much easier.</p>
<h2>Leadership Isn’t a Popularity Contest</h2>
<p>One of my favorite George W. Bush quotes came from an appearance on Oprah’s show to promote his book, “Decision Points.” He said, “One of my proudest moments is I didn&#8217;t sell my soul for the sake of popularity.”</p>
<p>Some media pundits chose to call this a joke &#8211; and it may have been, partially, as he is known for his sense of humor and his ability to poke fun at himself. There is a kernel of truth encapsulated in that comment, however, and it is one of the foundations of the former president’s leadership philosophy: remaining steadfast in his decisions, no matter what.</p>
<p>From a leadership perspective, that’s something I took away as well. Make the right decision, based on the information you have. Benchmark it against your core values and then, more importantly, realize that some of your decisions aren’t going to be popular &#8211; you’re never going to make everyone happy.</p>
<p>Even in my own organization, I try to do the right thing. That’s a value that I live by. If you’re doing the right thing, your decisions may not be popular &#8211; and you may not get credit for them &#8211; but that’s OK, as long as you’ve done the right thing.</p>
<h2>Life Lessons</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-33431" title="NickBaileywithAlexLange-caption" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/NickBaileywithAlexLange-caption-300x291.png" alt="Nick Bailey and Alex Lange, Market Leader executives, at the Gathering of Eagles conference for leaders in the real estate industry" width="300" height="291" />One final takeaway is more of a life lesson than a leadership lesson.</p>
<p>President Bush spoke about his last day in the White House and how, when he walked out the door for the last time, he had no idea what to do with himself.</p>
<p>When one is accustomed to moving at light speed, the sudden slowdown can be a challenge. A highly intelligent man, George W. Bush realized that the presidency was but one stage in his life and he needed to find something else to motivate him and help feed the drive and ambition that still remained. That urge to stay young and keep his mind fresh drove him to find other interests that held value for him.</p>
<p>So, he took up painting. Actually, he immersed himself fully into painting, hiring a coach who would come to the house to teach him how to paint. It has become a great passion for him. In fact, he had been painting in the car on the way over to meet with us and bore paint under his fingernails as proof.</p>
<p>The takeaway from this is that no matter what stage of life you’re in, find something that you’re passionate about so that it continues to drive and motivate you.</p>
<h2>Lasting Impressions</h2>
<p>I was curious to learn what other attendees considered takeaways from the conversation with the former president. The following day, I had a chance to find out.</p>
<p>Jack Kreider, vice president of regional development with RE/MAX LLC, was taken aback by how engaging President Bush is. “He is far more dynamic, charismatic, funny, engaging, and intelligent in person than he appeared as president (or maybe it was the media’s presentation of him),” he said.</p>
<p>Kreider also mentioned how easy it was to forget about Bush’s foreign relations expertise and enjoyed the former president’s insight into other countries and their leaders.</p>
<p>Bob McAdams, president of Real Living Real Estate, agreed, saying that President Bush’s view on world affairs was fascinating.</p>
<p>Sherry Chris, president and CEO of <a href="https://bhgrefranchise.com/">Better Homes and Gardens® Real Estate</a>, mentioned how she’d had the privilege of meeting President Clinton as well. She described the parallels between the two men, such as their commanding presence and how adept they are at interfacing with people, whether they know them well or not.</p>
<p>Rich Rector, CEO of Realty Executives International and co-author of “The E-Myth Real Estate Brokerage,” thanked Trulia and Market Leader for the opportunity to be included in such an intimate setting with a past president, saying that it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p>
<p>Leadership involves making hard choices, whether choosing between two good options or two distasteful options. Having a touchstone of core values is paramount when faced with both situations. Decisions that are anchored in a coherent set of principles allow a leader the confidence to remain steadfast.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/leadership-lessons-from-a-former-u-s-president/">Leadership Lessons From a Former U.S. President</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

<p>Last week the marketing managers from Market Leader went to a local conference called <a> MarketMix 2014</a>. This daylong event was put on by the local chapter of the American Ma<br />
rketing Association. The event had a lot of great speakers and insights, and while the tips offered were not necessarily from the real estate industry, we translated them to help your real estate business.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at three key insights from the conference.</p>
<h2>1. Be Able to Answer: Why Does My Business Exist?</h2>
<p>In the session presented by Andrew Sherrard, senior vice president of marketing at T-Mobile, we learned that T-Mobile completely rethought their overall strategy. They wondered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why do we exist?</li>
<li>Would anyone miss us?</li>
<li>Would anyone create a similar company to us?</li>
<li>What do people like or not like about our business?</li>
</ul>
<p>After answering those questions, T-Mobile changed its marketing, product plans and fees to reflect a new philosophy of “fair, simple, great value, and customer-focused” which led to their “Un-carrier” campaign.</p>
<h3>Sure, that’s great, but how does this relate to real estate?</h3>
<p>Before starting your marketing plan, it is best to first figure out why your business exists. What is the mission statement for your business? For example, “My business exists to help residents in my community find their ‘comfort zone’ (aka new home).” What is your value proposition, or summary of all the benefits you provide to homebuyers and sellers? In other words, why should they choose you instead of the agent down the street?</p>
<p>Being able to answer these questions is a crucial step in developing your unique selling points, and your ability to convert your leads into clients. As you contemplate what distinguishes you from other agents and why your business exists, your goal should be to stand out to potential clients. Think about what would appeal to potential buyers.<br />
Some ideas to stand out:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Do you respond quickly? Many homebuyers complain that agents are hard to get ahold of. Is that you, or do you respond to all communications within five minutes?</li>
<li>Do you have special offers, such as a home-buying guide, home warranty, or home staging services?</li>
<li>Are you an area expert?</li>
<li>Are you a specialist with a certain type of homebuyer, such as first-time homebuyers, veterans, or international buyers?</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>After you have come up with your selling points, use them in your marketing and when you speak to potential customers. This should help you convert more leads to clients.</p>
<h2>2. Personalize Your Marketing to Your Leads</h2>
<p>Another session Market Leader attended was “Seven Technology Trends” with the director of marketing and personalization technology from Nordstrom. There were seven technology trends to pay attention to, including facial recognition, marketing profiles, wearables, data experimentation, triggered automation, and content automation, but the most relevant one to agents was personalization. Using behavioral data to create profiles is the new way of marketing. For instance, tracking what your audience is doing when they interact with you, including pages visited, clicks, apps used, emails read, or social interactions.</p>
<p>Personalizing your marketing to your audience is key. In retail, which email do you think is more likely to get customers to buy shoes, one that shows similar shoes to those they viewed on a retail site, or an email showing a selection of random shoes? It should be obvious that the email with similar shoes is likely to have a better outcome. In fact, Nordstrom mentioned that 41 percent of consumers buy more from retailers who provide personalized emails.</p>
<h3>How does this relate to real estate?</h3>
<p>This is directly applicable to how you should think about your leads and emails. Segment your leads by their behavior on your website. Your emails should be targeted to a lead’s interest. A buyer who is looking at all single-family homes in a suburb probably would not be interested in a listing alert for condos in the city. Make sure your listing alerts match a lead’s search history on your site. By sending personalized relevant messages, you will better engage your leads and make your emails a resource, instead of an annoyance.</p>
<h2>3. Believe in the Impossible</h2>
<p>We got inspiration from the session with Liftport Lunar Space Elevator.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a profound difference between difficult, very very hard, and impossible,&#8221; according to Michael Laine. He is building an elevator from the moon into space, which might seem impossible, but his company is making it possible and is on track to be operational by 2020.</p>
<p>In other words, aim high and not just say something is impossible. Don’t take no for an answer. Instead, create a goal for your business that you believe is almost impossible, and create a plan to get there. Also called a “vision statement,” this should be the best possible outcome of all your hard work. You might aim to be a millionaire, or double your monthly transactions, or to reach whatever goal will push your business to another level.</p>
<p>That is how you grow your career and accomplish more then you thought possible.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/marketing-tips-from-marketmix-2014/">Marketing Tips From MarketMix 2014</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On March 13, 2014, over 200 real estate professionals met in Tukwila, Wash., for REBarCamp (aka REBC) to spend the day making new connections, networking, listening, and learning from each other on how to master and grow their real estate businesses. The format and rules for the event were simple: share your advice, lean in, participate in conversations, no sales pitches or presentations, all thoughts and opinions are welcome, and utilize the “two-feet rule,” which means get up and walk out of the session if it doesn’t met your expectations or needs. And lastly, a reminder that this is an “unconference” – participants are to share and mastermind with attendees and walk home with actionable ideas.</p>
<p>Since it was my first time attending and the first time Market Leader was an event sponsor at a unconference of this nature, I was on the edge of my seat with excitement. Upon check-in, I wrote down a few topics on index cards that I wanted to learn more about and felt I could contribute to. But I didn’t know until the final agenda was posted which ones would make the list.</p>
<p>Once the agenda with room assignments was posted (see image to right), I realized I was in for a treat since many of my favorites made the list. Here are the big “a-has” that I walked home with from this event:</p>
<h2>#1: Develop a Strategic Social Media Plan</h2>
<p>You can’t reach an end goal unless you know where you currently stand. Same goes with growing your real estate practice. You must first develop a strategic plan that includes outlining and defining the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plan Goal(s)/Objective(s)</strong> – your business goals.</li>
<li><strong>Strategies</strong> – Outline the steps you’ll take to achieve your goals.</li>
<li><strong>Success Metrics</strong> – How will you measure your goals?</li>
<li><strong>Conduct a SWOT analysis of your current social media efforts</strong> – Outline strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats and/or benchmarks of other companies in your niche. Check out <a href="/blog/swot-analysis-for-real-estate-agents/">these tips for creating a real estate SWOT analysis</a> if you need help.</li>
<li><strong>Audience(s)</strong> – Identify your key target market.</li>
<li><strong>Core value messaging</strong> – Define your company’s mission statement, vision and core values*.</li>
<li><strong>Timing</strong> – Create an editorial calendar or approach to your plan.</li>
<li><strong>Action Plan</strong> – tactical steps.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #993300;">*Tip: Click</span> <a href="http://d11consulting.com/">here</a> <span style="color: #993300;">to download a free ebook, “Define Your Core Values,” by</span> <a href="https://twitter.com/debra11">Debra Trappen</a><span style="color: #993300;">.</span></span></em></p>
<h2><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft  wp-image-28991" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Agent-Fishing2-300x200.jpg" alt="Real estate agents use a lead generation solution to fish for leads " width="240" height="160" />#2: Learn to Fish Using Your Own Bait &amp; Strong Lures</h2>
<p>You’ve heard the Chinese Proverb: “Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.” Same goes with generating leads in real estate, you could fish on your own, but you’ll be more successful having the right tools in your tackle box.</p>
<p>One must learn how to attract and find online buyers and sellers and which tools to use to “hook” them as quickly as possible. As discussed at REBC, the secrets to catching or engaging an online lead include building <strong>TRUST</strong>, being <strong>RESPONSIVE</strong> preferably, being the first to respond to a lead within the first five minutes, and engaging your leads with listing alerts and campaigns using your business <strong>CORE VALUES</strong> in your marketing pieces, messaging, team culture and sales approach to attract your ideal target audience. You also want to be sure your bait is good – providing fresh, relevant <strong>CONTENT</strong> that pertains to your <strong>AUDIENCE</strong> will keep them coming back. Purchasing leads (aka lures) from companies like Trulia or Market Leader will provide you with opportunities and new leads to keep your sales pipeline full and teach you how to fish so your business is successful for a lifetime.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><em>Want to catch more fish? Download our free guide, “<a href="http://www.marketleader.com/landing/lead_generation_guide?lsr=AI-ROW-Organic-BLG-CompleteGuideToLeadGeneration&amp;del=CGLeadGeneration&amp;Brd=ROW&amp;Chl=Organic&amp;Cpgn=CompleteGuideToLeadGeneration&amp;SChl=BLG">Complete Guide to Lead Generation,</a>” to learn key strategies to generate more online leads.</em></span></p>
<h2>#3: Be Authentic &amp; Real</h2>
<p>People love stories. Marketing messages via storytelling is trending these days. Why? Consumers are more likely to purchase based on an emotional response. Four reasons consumers most likely don’t buy from you: no trust, no need, no money, or no urgency. Stories evoke emotion and build trust. Test different mediums to showcase your authentic self – use video to share a welcome message, write a blog that shares your insights and knowledge, use an e-newsletter to stay in touch with customers. Make it engaging and human. After all, you’re working with people.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><em>“People don&#8217;t buy what you do; they buy why you do it. And what you do simply proves what you believe.” ― Simon Sinek, author of “Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action”</em></span></p>
<h2>#4: It’s Not About YOU</h2>
<p>Don’t post an image of one of your current listings on your Facebook business page and expect your sphere of influence to like and share it. Instead, share stories, client testimonials or a link to a current real estate listing marketing video. The video can show how you hired a professional videographer, a drone, and professional actors – demonstrating your occupation as a Realtor®, your brand niche, your expertise and a taste of your passion.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><em>Tip: To WIN you’ve got to first GIVE. And Market Leader did just that by giving away a $50 Amazon gift card at this event. Congratulations again to <a href="https://twitter.com/seattlecondo">Ben Kakimoto</a> with Keller Williams Greater Seattle who was selected as our winner!</em></span></p>
<h2>#5: Be Purposeful With Prospecting</h2>
<p>Each social network has a different purpose and culture of socializing. The key to your success in growing fans and followers is to determine how to spin the same content for each platform that connects with your audience and initiates a conversation. Someone at <em>REBarCamp</em> described this well:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong> Facebook</strong> is for posting news about a family barbecue party, not for posting all the homes you sold last week or hope to sell next month.</li>
<li><strong> LinkedIn</strong> is for posting your resume, researching companies and networking, not for sharing your daughter’s dance recital photo.</li>
<li><strong> Google Plus</strong> is for building relationships, sharing knowledge, and building SEO.</li>
<li><strong> Pinterest</strong> is for building brand identity with the use of photos and images.</li>
</ul>
<h2>#6: Be Consistent</h2>
<p>It sounds rudimentary, but the key to any social media strategy is being consistent. Create an editorial calendar and action plan, and keep your content consistent. Start with just one channel and build upon that while staying true to the messaging you defined in your plan.</p>
<p><em>Have you attended a REBarCamp lately? If so, please share your insights in the comment section below. I look forward to fishing with you again very soon!</em></p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/takeaways-from-the-real-estate-barcamp-trenches-greater-seattle-2014/">Takeaways From the Real Estate BarCamp Trenches – Greater Seattle 2014</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-26711" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ebc29bb292a447cf9f50aba8d0795dab1-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />It is event season for all those who live and breathe real estate transactions. And you know what that means: busy airports, flight delays, crowded hotel lobbies, packed break-out sessions, noisy convention halls, sales pitches, late night networking parties, and much more that make your head spin, your toes cramp and your back ache.</p>
<p>So I ask: WHY go?</p>
<p>Here are my top reasons WHY going will positively change your life and real estate business:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-size: large"><strong>R</strong></span><span style="font-size: small">EAL CONNECTIONS</span></span></p>
<p>As I mentioned in a previous blog post on <a href="/blog/why-real-estate-conferences-conventions-are-important-for-business/">networking at conventions</a>, face-to-face connections are worth their weight in GOLD. Helping people and networking is your passion. Seeing old friends and meeting new ones is the joy of your profession. Pass your business card to a new associate and shake hands with a colleague who lives in Brazil. Trust me, those real conversations you have and real people you meet will help to grow your business two-fold. Your colleague in Brazil just might think of you the next time he has the perfect client who wants to move to Denver.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small"><strong><span style="font-size: large">E</span></strong>DUCATION</span></p>
<p>RE/MAX® International Inc. has rolled out the red carpet again this year with an outstanding lineup of nationally recognized speakers, authors, celebrity athletes, heroes, fellow colleagues and business consultants. Some must-sees include: RE/MAX Technology Director Jeb Griffin (@JebGriffin), social media consultant Katie Lance (@KatieLance), Charis Moreno from Trulia (@TruliaPro), Steve Murray from REAL Trends (@StephenHMurray), Valerie Garcia from RE/MAX® Ontario (@Valeriegarcia1), and Bob Stewart from ActiveRain (@ActiveBob).</p>
<p>Learn from the best. Attend break-out sessions. Visit the <strong>RE/MAX Approved Supplier MarketPlace</strong>. Download the RE/MAX R4 Convention App. Ask questions. Watch demos. Go to workshops. Read the brochures. Listen to vendors. Challenge them to show you how their solution will help you succeed in real estate. Get there early, get educated and you’ll get results.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small"><span style="font-size: large"><strong>M</strong></span>OTIVATION</span></p>
<p>Over 4,000 fellow RE/MAX® agents and brokers from around the WORLD will be in attendance this year at the <strong>R4 convention (#remaxR4)</strong>. It’s exciting to know that you’re part of what makes the RE/MAX brand so strong. Listen to the leaders like Darren Hardy (@DARRENHARDY), the Publisher and Founding Director of SUCCESS magazine, and Simon Sinek (@simonsinek), who wrote “Leaders Eat Last” and “Start with WHY,” on how to succeed in business and grow teams. They will inspire you, push you and move you to expect more out of yourself. People like basketball league Earvin “Magic” Johnson (@MagicJohnson) and financial editor for NBC’s “Today” show, Jean Chatzky (@JeanChatzky), will make a difference. And those are just a few of the many speakers who will be participating. Be there, be present, and be ready to be inspired.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small"><strong><span style="font-size: large">A</span></strong>CCELERATE PROFITS</span></p>
<p>Don’t forget your ABCs: Always be closing. Remember, you’re there for business. Learn which online tools and technology will accelerate your real estate sales and make your brokerage profitable. Listen to your leaders and your peers, including real estate broker Nina Hollander from RE/MAX Executive Realty in Charlotte, N.C., who will be sharing her secrets to online leads at the Market Leader booth #123. Come by and join Market Leader’s <a href="https://learn.marketleader.com/display/coaching/Million+Dollar+Pipeline+Program">Million Dollar Pipeline Program</a>. Wake up early and don’t miss the chance to accelerate your profits in 2014!</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large"><strong>X</strong></span><span style="font-size: small">TREME FUN</span></p>
<p>Come on folks, we’re talking sin city, where “what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.” The Mandalay Bay hotel is gorgeous, and if the weather is warm, they might even open the pool for you. But if not, you can have fun shopping, walking down the strip, riding the roller coaster at night (no, you’re not too old), or simply spending time with colleagues and vendors. R4 wraps up with a party and concert you won’t want to miss, thanks to Keith Urban (@KeithUrban), country singer superstar. So grab your comfy shoes and have FUN!</p>
<p>If you are attending RE/MAX R4 convention this year, I’d love to hear your feedback and key takeaways!</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/remax-r4-convention-2014-why-go/">RE/MAX R4 Convention 2014: WHY Go?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You may not think you have much in common with Dave Liniger, co-founder of RE/MAX, but let me assure you: You do.<img loading="lazy" class="alignright" style="margin: 15px 10px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Helicopter_nickanddave.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<p>Real estate agents have been through a lot of adversity over the last few years, what with all the significant changes to the real estate market. Trying to adjust to market conditions has been pure hell for a lot of folks.</p>
<p>If you look at statistics, 30 to 35 percent of all Realtors® in the United States stepped out of the business in a three-year period of time, during the housing mess. Those that stuck with it are much stronger for having done so. Tenacity, courage, devotion and confidence are all qualities that you share with Liniger.</p>
<p>How did you get through that? How did you stay focused? How did you readjust based on circumstances around you?</p>
<p>If this is something you struggled with, or maybe still do, come learn from one of the leaders in the industry – and someone who knows adversity, intimately.</p>
<p>Liniger is a testament to meeting challenges head-on, from what he faced when he first started RE/MAX, to going through both the very best real estate market in the history of our country and the very worst market.</p>
<p>Add in the horrendous personal calamities he faced, and when you realize Liniger never wavered, you’ll be amazed. I think you’ll agree that this tenacity is what’s made him successful, even at a time when people are scrutinizing his business, scrutinizing his model and questioning their relevancy, based on market conditions.</p>
<p>Another key to Liniger’s and RE/MAX’s success is that they know who they are, they know who their customer is, and they know how to make an agent more successful tomorrow than they are today. That rock-solid confidence that he is known for is what has brought him through personal and professional adversities and has created such great success.</p>
<p>ActiveRain’s Bob Stewart is hosting a webinar with Liniger on ActiveRain University this Tuesday, June 18 at10 a.m. Mountain time. It promises to be filled with inspiration, both personal and professional. Sure, Liniger will talk about real estate, but he’ll also tell us about his miraculous recovery from a near-death encounter – a revelation into the resiliency of the human spirit.</p>
<p>If you haven’t read Liniger’s new book, “My Next Step: An Extraordinary Journey of Healing and Hope,” you must tune in to the webinar. I heard him speak at the RE/MAX R4 convention this past February, and I’m sure he’ll go into detail about what happened to him &#8211; how he thought he just had back pain and ended up in the hospital in intensive care with his organs completely shutting down. He was in intensive care, out of consciousness, for two and a half months. His journey to recovery is a pretty inspiring story.</p>
<p>Most of all, listen in to learn how his experience, leadership, inspiration and motivation correlates to being an agent today. As I said at the outset, you have a lot in common with my friend Dave Liniger. Come learn for yourself.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/nickanddave-edited.jpg" alt="" width="384" height="335" /></p>
<p><em>In a previous life, Nick Bailey, vice president of business strategy for Market Leader, was employed in a powerhouse 12-year career with RE/MAX. A licensed real estate agent, he started with the company as a management consultant and quickly moved up to vice president of regional operations for Ohio and Pennsylvania. From there, he added vice president duties for Florida and the eastern U.S. </em></p>
<p><em>Bailey worked closely with RE/MAX co-founder Dave Liniger and the two remain friends to this day. If anyone has insight into what you can expect to hear from Liniger during the ActiveRain webinar, it’s Bailey.</em></p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/soaring-to-new-heights-with-dave-liniger/">Soaring to New Heights With Dave Liniger</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-13251" title="Networking With Real Estate Agents" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Fotolia_31002500_XS-300x200.jpg" alt="Networking with other real estate agents can help build your business - if you do it right" width="300" height="200" />We’ve all heard that networking is an essential aspect of strong business development. What many in the real estate industry don’t seem to get, however, is that networking’s sole aim is to grow and promote your business.</p>
<p>Looked at through that lens, the value of networking for real estate agents lies in hanging out with people that can help them find clients, not those that are competing for those very same leads.</p>
<h2>Networking With Other Agents in Town</h2>
<p>It appears that the real estate industry generally conflates networking with socializing, and those are distinctly different animals.</p>
<p>Remember, other agents in your market are highly unlikely to promote your business in any way, shape or form, so networking with them, in the strict sense of the word, is useless.</p>
<p>Socializing, on the other hand, may be of immense value, but for different reasons. Who doesn’t need to blow off steam from time-to-time, and what better way to do that than with someone who does what you do for a living?</p>
<p>Who else understands the frustration of a listing client who insists on overpricing the home, or the buyer who lowballs every list price and wonders why his offers aren’t accepted? From commiserating to sharing ideas, having lunch, cocktails or coffee with another agent in your market is good for the soul.</p>
<p>Just don’t think of it as networking, and don’t waste valuable time socializing with your competition under the guise of networking.</p>
<h2>Networking With Out-of-Town Agents</h2>
<p>Whether in person at conferences and conventions or via social media, networking with out-of-town agents is true networking. These agents are in a position to help you build and promote your business, and these relationships require cultivation and nurturing. Here are a few tips to think about before you attend your next conference:</p>
<ul>
<li>Say hello. No matter where you are &#8211; in line at the restroom, at a booth on the exhibit floor, waiting for a cocktail at the hotel bar &#8211; smile and say hello to everyone. This one simple word can spark a conversation, a connection, and maybe even a real estate deal down the line.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Take advantage of breaks between speakers. This isn’t the time to check voicemail and email. Author and speaker Thom Singer suggests that you smile at people, approach them and ask questions, such as, “How are you enjoying the conference,” or “Who is your favorite speaker so far?” Ditch the elevator pitch, or “verbal vomit,” as Singer calls it, and get the other person talking about him or herself. Then, don’t forget to listen.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Avoid sitting with someone you already know, unless it’s to nurture a new relationship. The idea is to expose yourself to as many new people as possible.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Arrive early to the evening events. This is especially important if you’re on the shy side. This way you won’t feel all eyes on you when you walk in. Plus, the conversation starts up around you. Instead of having to walk into a conversation, you’ll already be a part of one.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Make a quick note on the back of all business cards you receive to help you remember where you met the person and the highlights of what you chatted about.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Follow-Up</h2>
<p>Follow up isn’t just for clients. Follow your new associates on Twitter, invite them to be friends on Facebook, and email things of interest occasionally. Just as you keep in touch with past clients, reach out and touch your agent contacts across the country and the globe to remind them that you sell real estate in your town.</p>
<p>Real estate agents only have so many hours in a day to devote to each aspect of a thriving business. Networking time should be spent with other businesspeople &#8211; especially those who can help build your business, such as lenders and title people.</p>
<p>Sure, it’s important to maintain good working relationships with other agents in town, but not at the expense of getting yourself in front of those who can help you.</p>
<p>When time is at a premium and you have to choose between networking opportunities, go with the one that offers the best chance that you will be the only real estate agent in the room.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/is-it-important-to-network-with-other-agents/">Is It Important to Network With Other Agents?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

I’m a little jealous that several of my event marketing peeps, like Alex Allison with Dot Loop and Dan Stewart of Happy Grasshopper, are in New York City this week attending one of the most influential real estate industry events of the year, Real Estate Connect New York City, hosted by Inman News. Not only is NYC one of my favorite cities to visit, but Inman Connect stays true to its name. It’s all about bringing the smartest, most talented speakers and technology gurus within the real estate industry together to connect and inspire. (If you want to learn the true value of this, read my blog post on why <a href="/blog/why-real-estate-conferences-conventions-are-important-for-business/">real estate industry events</a> are important for business.)</p>
<p>Attendees will get to hang out with Katie Lance and Chris Smith from Inman News, two of my favorite peeps within the industry. The <a href="https://events.inman.com/inman-connect-new-york">agenda</a> at Real Estate Connect New York City is packed with outstanding topics and sessions. If you’re looking to extend your business trip over the weekend, here are a few of my travel tips to New York City. This list is compiled from several emails from friends and family members who live in the Big Apple, so it’s sure to be worth the read or another visit!</p>
<h2>Helpful Travel Hints:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bring cash, and don’t forget to tip the chambermaid at your hotel &#8211; <a href="https://www.tripsavvy.com/guide-to-tipping-in-new-york-city-4177115">here&#8217;s a guide to tipping in NYC</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Buses are the best for getting across town and to events downtown. Don’t rule them out for transportation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Cabs now take credit cards. Even though they are pricier, cabs are my preferred mode of transportation – riding in one is an adventure!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Make reservations for dinner. You will end up wasting time if you don’t.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Looking to book a corporate party last minute? Check out Shecky’s NY Party Aid – I’ve never used them, but heard they are legit.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Dress to impress – bouncers in NYC are notorious for judging you on your outfit and cuteness, so be sure to grab your younger self to get into the popular nightclubs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>NYC Eats:</h2>
