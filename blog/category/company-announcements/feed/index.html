<p><strong><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-60932 alignright" src="http://www.marketleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2022-HWTech100-RealEstate-Black-01-300x84.png" alt="" width="300" height="84" /><br />
MARCH 3, 2022 BELLEVUE, WASH:</strong> HousingWire has announced the 2022 Tech100 honorees, recognizing the most innovative technology companies in the real estate industry.</p>
<p>The Tech100 is the only program in the real estate industry that highlights technology innovation and recognizes companies that continuously raise the bar. Outlining the most innovative and impactful organizations that provide solutions to the challenges that real estate professionals face every day, the Tech100 grows more competitive every year as the demand for technology in the industry continues to progress.</p>
<p>“This year’s list of Tech100 honorees proves once again that innovation within housing is vital in differentiating the organizations who will thrive and those who will be left behind,” said Clayton Collins, CEO of HW Media. “This list spotlights the innovators that are making the housing sector better and more sustainable by increasing efficiency, improving experiences and bringing elasticity and improvements to age-old processes.”</p>
<p>“Residential real estate has seen massive change the past few years, from accelerated technology adoption and innovation to the forced digitization in a traditionally belly-to-belly business, and I’m proud of the remarkable amount of work the Market Leader team has done to bring value to our agents and the clients they serve,” said Robert Vickers, General Manager at Market Leader. “As true technology partners, we’ve made it our mission to internalize the voice of our customer to provide solutions that help them drive meaningful connections and deliver exceptional experiences, as demonstrated by the recognition here.”</p>
<p>Vickers was also named a <a href="https://www.rismedia.com/newsmaker/robert-vickers-2022-2/">Futurist</a> in RISMedia’s 2022 Newsmakers, recognized for his contributions to the real estate industry as a leader of change and driver of innovation.</p>

<p>June 3, 2021</p>
<p>BELLEVUE, WA: Market Leader, a leading provider of sales and marketing solutions in the real estate industry, today announced the launch of Facebook Leads. Available exclusively to Market Leader customers, Facebook Leads allows real estate professionals to get in front of Facebook’s 258 million active monthly users across the U.S. and Canada without having to build or manage advertising campaigns.</p>
<p>Facebook Leads leverages Market Leader’s team of advertising experts to build and optimize targeted Facebook campaigns and generate leads for customers, alleviating the challenges associated with Facebook’s complex Ads Manager platform. Market Leader’s advertising team has decades of experience running high volumes of ads across multiple platforms, generating powerful insights and optimization that benefits customers.</p>
<p>Agents remain in complete control of their budget and target markets, and can adjust their spend monthly as needs change. No contract is required to sign up.</p>
<p>Market Leader eliminates the largest barrier to advertising on Facebook today by allowing customers who do not have Facebook accounts to take advantage of Facebook Leads.</p>
<p>“Getting real estate agents in front of consumers looking to buy or sell a home has been at the core of what we do for over 20 years,” said Robert Vickers, General Manager of Market Leader. “Facebook Leads is another way for us to help our customers grow their sphere and capture leads, while removing the challenges that traditionally accompany Facebook advertising. We’re excited to provide our customers the benefits of social media advertising, without having to navigate the complexities of managing an additional platform or optimizing campaigns.”</p>
<p>“Facebook Leads by Market Leader automatically markets my listings as soon as they hit the MLS and gets me in front of home buyers and sellers in my area,” said Elizabeth Avery, RE/MAX Northwest REALTORS®, “I love that it feeds leads directly into my CRM and has taken the pain of managing ads off my plate, but gives me complete control over my monthly budget.”</p>
<p>With one of the largest IDX footprints across North America, Market Leader uses existing MLS integrations to automatically create and adjust ads for both active and recently sold listings as agents get a new listing or sale, generating high volumes of hyper-targeted impressions on Facebook’s network of 258 million users. Additionally, home buying and selling guides, developed in partnership with top-producing agents, are used to attract buyers and sellers in target areas, optimized based on consumer behavior to deliver customers the most impressions to grow their sphere.</p>
<p>Market Leader customers simply select their budget and target cities for Facebook Leads directly from their Market Leader system to get started.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Market Leader and Keller Williams announce extended multi-year partnership</h1>
<p>We&#8217;re excited to extend our multi-year partnership with Keller Williams and be named a Premier Platinum Partner in the Keller Cloud Innovator Program!</p>
<p>As technology partners, we look forward to continuing to provide KW Associates tools that increase productivity through our long-term partnership.</p>
<h3>Full press release:</h3>
<p>AUSTIN, Texas&#8211;(<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/" rel="nofollow">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)&#8211;Keller Williams (“KW”), the world&#8217;s largest real estate franchise by agent count and the U.S. leader in units and sales volume, announces Market Leader, a pioneer in sales and marketing technology for the real estate industry, as a Platinum Partner in the Keller Cloud Innovator Program.</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="pull-quote">“Our Innovator Program is a giant leap for us at KW and real estate as a whole,” said Josh Team, president, @kwri. “We’ve created a true innovation hub &#8211; an environment where we can bring to life the best ideas from the most innovative disruptors.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“We&#8217;re excited to continue to partner with Market Leader and plug their applications into the Keller Cloud,” said Josh Team, president, Keller Williams. “This collaboration offers our agents the opportunity to leverage Market Leader products in their businesses, and in turn, Market Leader solutions are strengthened through their integration with the most robust data-driven smart platform in real estate.”</p>
<p>Through the Keller Cloud Innovator Program (“KCIP”), KW collaborates with leading technology companies, like Market Leader, to enhance the operations of real estate businesses via the Keller Cloud, a proprietary, AI-fueled real estate cloud for Keller Williams agents.</p>
<p>Using a Keller Cloud application programming interface, or API, available for outside technology developers, KCIP enables the integration of additional top technology tools within an agent’s Keller Cloud solutions.</p>
<p>Through benefits resulting from the KCIP, KW agents can now further customize Command, a smart CRM-plus suite of solutions. Recently, KW released Command into a general availability lab for its agents.</p>
<p>Market Leader Pro, a set of tools for agents to generate and close more business, will also be included in the launch of the forthcoming KW Marketplace: an app store for KW agents to browse top software integrations made by non-Keller Williams developers.</p>
<p>“We’ve been a proud technology partner to Keller Williams Realty for the past eight years with the common goal of delivering tools that increase productivity,” said Scott Smith, president and general manager, Market Leader and Constellation Real Estate Group. “And, we’re delighted to extend our multi-year partnership to provide KW and their associates a competitive advantage.”</p>
<p>Market Leader has been a partner with KW since 2011, being principally involved with KW’s award-winning eEdge platform, a complete lead-to-close business solution.</p>
