										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you use social media in your real estate marketing to market listings, </span><a href="/blog/real-estate-agents-need-a-brand/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">brand your business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and grow your network? Understanding social media algorithms on each platform can seem daunting. Not only does each platform prioritize different types of interactions, their algorithms prioritize different types of content.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re creating a content or social media marketing strategy, be sure to identify your goals for each channel, and optimize content for each platform to best serve them. Understanding how each platform prioritizes content is crucial to an effective strategy. Work smarter, not harder. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help you understand what each social media platform aims to do and get a handle on their respective algorithms, we give you the real estate social media algorithm guide. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook</span></h2>
<h4><b>Algorithm prioritizes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Meaningful, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">active</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> interactions.<br />
</span><b>Why</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: They want the time people spend on Facebook to be quality time, so they are prioritizing posts from friends and family, and content that sparks conversations. </span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Here together,” is Facebook’s latest mantra. The platform has officially set out to foster and prioritize meaningful interactions specifically among </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">friends and family</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, rather than business pages. This means less public content will show up in user’s news feeds. This also means that, if Facebook is your primary channel for social media marketing, you’ve likely noticed a difference in your organic reach and engagements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As scary as the Facebook algorithm change sounds for the businesses that use it as a platform to network, promote their business and listings, the changes are inherently simple. Before posting, ask yourself the following questions: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will this post educate, inform, inspire, or entertain people? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will this post start a conversation? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will this post be shared by others? </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your answer to the first question wasn’t a resounding, “YES,” reconsider posting it. All algorithms aside, if your content isn’t serving any of the above purposes, you might want to rethink your marketing strategy entirely. </span></p>
<p>Bottom line: 80 percent of content you share share on Facebook should educate, inspire, or entertain people; the other 20 percent can market your business.</p>
<p>You can still use Facebook as a means to market your business, but if it&#8217;s reach you want, you might have to pay to play by boosting posts or running ads.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram</span></h2>
<h4><b>Algorithm prioritizes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Timely, engaging posts from relevant users.<br />
</span><b>Why</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Instagram wants to show its users the best, relevant content to the most people. </span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although owned by Facebook, Instagram’s algorithm prioritizes content differently than that of its parent company. Where the Facebook algorithm aims to foster meaningful interactions, Instagram‘s mission is to put relevant, engaging content in front of people in a timely fashion. You may remember a few years ago when Instagram introduced its algorithm, changing users’ feeds from a chronological experience to what it deemed relevant and engaging.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Factors that influence Instagram’s algorithm: </span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Engagement</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; likes, comments, shares, video views, AND how quickly users engage with a post</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Time spent consuming </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; this applies to photos, as well as videos. If a user clicks the caption to read more, Instagram views this as increased consumption.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Frequent Consumption</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; regular saves, likes, comments, and shares from users will prioritize your content in their feed. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Timeliness</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; read, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">recency</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Relevancy </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; content genres exist! Have you ever followed multiple accounts with similar content? We’re talking memes, animals (#catsofinstagram), sports highlights, or inspo (interior decorating, fashion, inspirational quotes, etc.).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always know your target audience so you can optimize your content, taking the above factors into consideration. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">LinkedIn</span></h2>
<h4><b>Algorithm prioritizes:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Engagement and connection strength.<br />
</span><b>Why: </b>To show users news, timely and popular content valuable to other professionals, and job posts. LinkedIn is clear about one thing: being a professional platform.</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before investing too much time trying to grow a consumer-facing business on a platform designed for professionals, consider whether LinkedIn is </span><a href="/blog/is-linkedin-worth-your-time/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">right for you</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LinkedIn’s algorithm is unique in that content can potentially go through </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">four </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">rounds of content review. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assuming a piece of content or post makes it through LinkedIn’s initial SPAM filter, it will publish to the feed temporarily to measure quality and engagement.  If your content signals that it’s both quality and engaging, it will continue on to the next stage of </span><a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2018/03/a-look-behind-the-ai-that-powers-linkedins-feed--sifting-through"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LinkedIn’s AI-powered algorithm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, if your post is flagged or hidden from any user’s timeline, LinkedIn will consider that negative feedback and the half-life of your post could stop there. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third stage in LinkedIn’s algorithm checks for virality, assessing the quality of the poster and their network. This is to ensure both the poster and their network are not suspicious. In addition to vetting the credibility of the poster, the algorithm will also determine relevance and usefulness of the post to others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fourth and final stage a post will pass through on LinkedIn before getting a full-fledged green light is… wait for it… a human filter. In this stage, LinkedIn uses real people to review content and determine whether a post is valuable to others.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Factors that influence LinkedIn’s algorithm: </span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Engagement </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; likes, comments, shares, and how quickly users engage with a post. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Connection Strength </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; if users frequently engage with your posts, they’re more likely to see them. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Hashtags</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; LinkedIn is now promoting the use of hashtags so if you tag your post properly, and your page isn’t private, your post can be found publicly for anyone interested in those topics!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Professional &#8211; <span style="font-weight: 400;">avoid political, religious, or overly personal commentary. </span></b></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter</span></h2>
<h4><b>Algorithm prioritizes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Tweets ranked by time and relevance to a user, using a scoring system.<br />
</span><b>Why</b>: Twitter wants to show its users the most relevant and time-sensitive content.</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter’s algorithm takes three main factors into consideration when determine what a user sees on their timeline: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tweet &#8211; consumption, engagement, type of media (image, gif, video), and recency.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tweetor &#8211; strength of connection the user has with the author, past interactions, when the connection was made.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The User &#8211; types of Tweets they’re likely to engage with, how often they use Twitter</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter’s primary goal is to serve Tweets to users who are likely to enjoy its content, engage with it, and strengthen engaging relationships. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In spring of 2018, Twitter </span><a href="https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2018/Serving_Healthy_Conversation.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a new approach to serving healthy conversations and reduce abuse, harassment, and “trolling” behaviors by identifying users who are likely to ‘distort and detract’ from public conversation. What does this mean for you? Here are a few ways to solidify your profile so your account and Tweets are prioritized: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Confirm your account email address</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t sign up for multiple accounts simultaneously</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contribute to healthy conversations on Twitter, be a part of the community</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pinterest</span></h2>
<h4><b>Algorithm prioritizes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Previous user interactions, relevance, quality, and interests.<br />
</span><b>Why</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Pinterest is a search engine that uses keywords, and its algorithm helps users find what they’ve shown interest in and care about.</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though it&#8217;s considered a social media platform like those mentioned above, Pinterest is also a search engine. It uses keywords to serve up relevant visuals for its users. Pinterest is used to plan and research ideas (think DIY remodel ideas, housewarming parties, interior decorating). Pair that with the fact that 40 percent of Pinterest users have a household income of over $100,000 and you can start to see why Pinterest is often underrated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okay, back to Pinterest’s algorithm. When you create a Pin, it’s shared with your followers first. If it performs well, your Pin will be distributed to people outside of your network who might be interested in it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might be noticing a trend among social platforms that prioritizes content algorithms find engaging, recent, and relevant but where PInterest differs from the others is SEO. In addition to an algorithm that ranks Pins based on the above, Pinterest’s algorithm uses keywords. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Follow these  best practices optimize your Pins: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use keyword-rich descriptions &#8211; put your consumer hat on and think about what your target audience might be searching for. “DIY home improvement ideas” might signal a homeowner looking to increase the value of their home before selling. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t delete underperforming Pins &#8211; they might gain traction later on.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stay within Pinterest’s preferred image ratio &#8211; 2:3 (width:height) and no taller than 900 pixels for optimal distribution </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to take up more space in a user’s feed.</span></li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Make it a New Year’s Resolution: Fully engage your real estate market on social media in 2020.</h3>
<h4>Here’s why:</h4>
<p><a href="/blog/the-truth-about-millennials-and-real-estate/">Millennials</a>, the most digitally-engaged generation by far, now constitute most new home buyers. They are also now the single biggest cohort of homebuyers overall – and will remain so for decades to come. Your real estate social media marketing will be the key to reaching them and staying in front of them.</p>
<h4>Consider the following:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Close to 99 percent of Millennials will be using the Internet in their home search. 58 percent of Millennial homebuyers report that they used a mobile device in the house-hunting process.</li>
<li>Nearly 6 in 10 millennials – 58 percent – found their home using a mobile device. 46 percent of Generation X homebuyers found their home on a mobile device.</li>
</ul>
<p>Until recently, most people used Google to search for listings and real estate agents. But increasingly, we’re seeing younger Americans bypass Google and go directly through their favorite social media platforms to find information.</p>
<h4>Video Is Ascendant</h4>
<p>Video is becoming a more important part of real estate marketing, especially as the industry develops new technologies, like virtual tours and drone footage. 73 percent of consumers say they are more likely to use a realtor who is active on YouTube – yet only 12 percent of agents are active on the platform, observes Brandon Gaille, a Houston area marketing consultant and blogger. The disconnect creates a prime opportunity for a real estate social media expert to exploit.</p>
<p>Yes, most older real estate agents are on social media. But if they’re restricting themselves to Facebook and Twitter, they’re missing a big chunk of the Millennial market, which has begun to migrate to newer, more visually-focused platforms like Snapchat and Instagram.</p>
<h3><strong>Real Estate Social Media Tips</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>1. Complete your profiles. </strong></h4>
<p>You can’t dominate every platform, all the time. But you can make sure that each major social media platform has a full, complete profile that reinforces your brand, your expertise, and takes readers to your home page and your listings. The average Internet user has seven accounts on various platforms. You want to be present on all of them. You can always link to your content on other platforms. But you don’t want to be absent!</p>
<h4><strong>2. Think beyond Facebook.</strong></h4>
<p>Yes, everyone is on Facebook. Facebook is the 800-pound gorilla of the social media world, with 79 percent of real estate agents actively using the platform. But don’t limit yourself to Facebook!</p>
<p>The median Pinterest user household has an income of about $50,000, 10 percent of Pinterest users have household incomes of over $125,000 per year, <a href="https://www.omnicoreagency.com/pinterest-statistics/">according to Omnicore,</a> which makes them among the most affluent of the social media user bases. Furthermore, Pinterest users are over 80 percent women. That makes them a more easily targeted demographic – and much less saturated by other real estate marketers.</p>
<p>If you aren’t using Pinterest yet, join the board or boards related to your community. If you can’t find one, even better: <em>You can start it!</em></p>
<h4><strong>3. Think visually. </strong></h4>
<p>Try to include a graphic with each post. <a href="https://business.twitter.com/en/basics/what-to-tweet.html">Twitter posts with photos have at least three times the engagement rates of posts without photos</a>, and other platforms are seeing similar results. With some platforms, like Instagram and Tumblr, nearly everyone else in your readers’ feeds will have images. If you aren’t thinking visually, your readers may just scroll pass the walls of text.</p>
<p>Try to incorporate memes, infographics, cartoons, videos, charts, professional photographs, and anything else that may draw the eye and set you apart. And brand everything you do with your name and logo, so they remember your name.</p>
<h4><strong>4. Blog frequently.</strong></h4>
<p>Studies show that businesses that blog frequently outperform those that don’t. Frequent updates keep content fresh, which is good for Google search results, and builds loyalty among readers. Furthermore, among real estate agents, the blogging field is wide open: <em>Only 11 percent of your competitors are currently blogging, nationwide. </em></p>
<h4><strong>5. Stay engaged. </strong></h4>
<p>Don’t just post and forget. Stay engaged with your social media audience and commenters. This is especially true in the blog and Twitter world, where many feeds are characterized as much by the commenters as the host.</p>
<h4><strong>6. Ask for the follow. </strong></h4>
<p>Sales professionals know to ‘ask for the sale.’ If you don’t ask, it won’t happen. Establish your real estate page on Facebook and wherever else you have a natural market – and <em>ask people to ‘like’ and ‘follow’ your page! </em></p>
<h4><strong>7. Serve the reader with every post. </strong></h4>
<p>Don’t post just to post. Each post should serve your readers in some way. Too many posts that are purely self-promotional and that don’t educate, entertain or move the reader in some way will quickly get an ‘unfollow.’ Don’t be boring, and don’t be selfish with your content.</p>
<p>It doesn’t always have to be “how to buy a home,” either. Community-minded posts on anything from local events to great local restaurants and date ideas can help brand you as an expert on the neighborhoods you’re targeting.</p>
<h4><strong>8. Have a ‘premium content’ offering. </strong></h4>
<p>It’s a great idea to create some premium content that helps establish you as an expert in your market. It could be anything from a new home buyer’s guide to a neighborhood event schedule to a home inspection checklist to a white paper on local economic trends. You can use social media to get the link in front of followers, but get something in return – an e-mail address, or permission to follow up with a phone call.</p>
<h4><strong>9. Schedule posts to reach the most readers. </strong></h4>
<p>For business to consumer social media transmissions, concentrate on posting on weekends and on Thursdays and Fridays, when office workers are already thinking about the weekend. Twitter engagement for consumers is 17 percent higher on weekends than during the week. Pinterest engagement reaches its peak around 9 PM.</p>
<p>Use social media management tools like <a href="https://hootsuite.com/">HootSuite</a> to help you schedule and manage your posts. That way, even if it’s 2AM when you finally have time to write that blog or tweet you’ve been meaning to write, you can still schedule it to post when it’s likely to get in front of the most eyeballs.</p>
<h4><strong>10. Measure your metrics. </strong></h4>
<p>Define the metrics most important to them, and measure them. Reinforce success. Carefully track leads generated from which platforms, and which platforms generate the most <em>local</em> interest for your efforts.</p>
<p>Don’t operate blind: Each platform offers a number of tools for its advertisers. For example, use Facebook’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/audience-insights">Audience Insights</a> tool to learn who is seeing your content – and guide your decision-making process when it comes to your social media strategy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Make 2018 the Year You Leverage Social Proof</h2>
<p>You have tons of experience. You offer stellar customer service. You’ve developed a killer website. Even your branding is cool.</p>
<p>Guess what? It’s not enough.</p>
<p>Not in 2018.</p>
<p>Like this year’s, next year’s clients want proof before they agree to work with you. And, they want proof from people who have actually used your real estate services.</p>
<p>Make 2018 the year you focus on gathering the social proof you need to help potential clients judge your credibility as a real estate authority, get to know you, and build trust.</p>
<h3>What is social proof?</h3>
<p>A herd of sheep will instinctually stick together, for protection. Where one goes, the others follow – whether it’s back to the farm for supper or to the slaughterhouse, the instinct rules.</p>
<p>We humans have similar inclinations. A famous 1969 study (Milgram et al.) on “the drawing power of crowds of different sizes” found that 4 percent of folks passing by would stop to join one person looking up at a skyscraper.</p>
<p>When there were 15 people looking skyward, the number of passersby who stopped to join them increased to 40 percent. Additionally, 86 percent of passersby, even if they didn’t stop, would look up to see what everyone was looking at.</p>
<p>“We often imitate others’ actions when making choices with limited information about what’s best,” claims David Stipp at <a href="https://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1996/10/14/217822/index.htm">Fortune.com</a>. “It’s almost a law of nature,” he concludes.</p>
<p>It’s herd behavior and, although it can have negative consequences, it can also be a boon to your marketing efforts.</p>
<h3>Why does it matter?</h3>
<p>A majority of the 2,000 Americans surveyed by Mintel, a market analysis agency, say that online reviews dictate which products they buy and services they use.</p>
<p>It’s only natural, right? We all want to ensure that we’re purchasing the “best” product or hiring the “best” hair stylist.</p>
<p>“In a never-ending quest to buy the ‘best,’ consumers are looking to others’ opinions and experiences via online review sites to validate their choices – and to avoid feeling buyers’ remorse,” Mintel’s Fiona O’Donnell claims in their American Lifestyles 2015 study.</p>
<p>Although consumers of all ages perform this gut check, it is far more common in millennials than in older and younger generations. And, since that particular demographic represents the real estate consumers of tomorrow, social proof becomes even more important.</p>
<h3>How is your online reputation?</h3>
<p>The first thing to consider when starting a social proof campaign is to determine where you stand right now. Will you be starting with a blank slate or multitudes of reviews scattered across the internet?</p>
<p>How many negative reviews will you need to combat? Cleaning up your online reputation takes time and effort unless you have the big bucks required to hire a company to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2013/03/14/6-steps-to-managing-your-online-reputation/?sh=5a12293b7767">manage your online reputation.</a></p>
<p>And, lest you think image polishing isn’t important, consider this: 75 percent of HR professionals and recruiters say that they have “personnel to research applicants online,” according to a Cross-Tab <a href="https://www.job-hunt.org/guides/DPD_Online-Reputation-Research_overview.pdf">study</a>.</p>
<p>Even more frightening (at least for job hunters) is that 70 percent of these hiring pros claim that they have rejected candidates based on what they found out about them online.</p>
<p>Sure, you’re not hoping to be recruited, but if HR professionals seek out social proof for job applicants, it’s a safe bet that real estate consumers do the same when researching real estate agents.</p>
<h3>Types of social proof to consider for your real estate business:</h3>
<p><strong>Review sites</strong> &#8212; It’s not enough to have online reviews and testimonials on one site. Gut checkers view two to three different review sites before they make a decision, according to BrightLocal’s Consumer Review Survey 2016.</p>
<p>When researching real estate agents, these review sites typically include Yelp, Zillow and Google. Since Google search results for “real estate agents in” typically come with Google reviews, it’s a good idea to concentrate on the search giant first. Setting up a <a href="https://www.google.com/business/?gmbsrc=us-en-ha-se-z-gmb-s-z-h~bk&amp;ppsrc=GMBS0&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI8v7G8IWF1wIVCmh-Ch2LrQtWEAAYASAAEgIDkvD_BwE&amp;dclid=CImD6PeFhdcCFRB2Ygodb-APEA">Google Business Page</a> is a great place to start.</p>
<p><strong>Testimonials</strong> – BrightLocal’s survey found that the “authenticity of reviews is the most important factor for consumers to trust the reviews they read.” They want to know that these testimonials are coming from actual people – clients who have used you to represent them when buying or selling a home.</p>
<p>Bring your testimonials to life by including a photo of your clients (with their permission, of course) <a href="/blog/2018-real-estate-trends-content-marketing-reigns-king/">above</a> their glowing recommendation.</p>
<p><strong>Case studies</strong> – These are another way to give life to your testimonials. They are basically stories that illustrate a client’s problem and how you, as an agent, solved it. Not only are they effective on websites, but because of they are typically photo-intensive, they work well when included with other marketing materials, such as listing presentations and newsletters.</p>
<p><strong>Take it offline, too. </strong></p>
<p>Testimonials can be used in all of your marketing materials as long as you don’t overdo it. Choose one or two of your favorites and use them in your newsletters.</p>
<p>Use them in listing presentations, on door hangers, direct mail pieces – all of your offline marketing materials can and should contain at least one testimonial.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/2018-real-estate-trends-social-proof/">2018 Real Estate Trends: Social Proof</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although social media is already widely accepted as a branding tool for real estate agents and brokers, it can also be a powerful </span><a href="/blog/thriving-in-the-internet-era-understanding-generating-and-converting-online-leads/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lead generating</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tool. Over 70 percent of Americans have social media accounts, and you can use YouTube, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, and other platforms to target leads, establish your expertise, and form connections with prospective clients located within your farm area. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind that people use social media to relax, entertain themselves, find out what’s trending, and keep in touch with family and friends. So, you can’t use too many sales pitches and need to provide value in a way that people are used to seeing on social media. If you do that, social media can do wonders for your real estate business and brand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This article explores how to turn 6 popular social media platforms into a highly effective lead generating machine.</span></p>
<h3><b>1. YouTube</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to data from the National Association of Realtors (NAR), </span><a href="https://www.inman.com/next/by-the-numbers-how-to-focus-your-video-marketing-for-the-biggest-return-on-investment/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">85% of buyers and sellers </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">want to work with an agent who uses video. As a result, YouTube can be a great source of leads, but most real estate agents have yet to take advantage of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first step is to create a branded YouTube channel &#8211; add your logo, color scheme, and a complete description of your services. Once you’ve done this, add a feature video of yourself to introduce yourself to potential clients. At this point, you can start creating listing videos, but as in all other social media platforms, the objective is not to saturate your content with too many sales pitches. Also post videos highlighting popular spots in your neighborhood, virtual tours, or drone videos of beautiful properties. Add a clear call to action at the end, with links to your website and contact details.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t need fancy equipment to shoot your videos. Most smartphones nowadays can shoot in 4k high definition, so you’ll still get quality results. Just invest in a basic tripod and tripod mount and follow these tips: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always use </span><a href="https://hyperlapse.instagram.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hyperlapse</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to reduce camera shaking in your videos</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disable the autofocus function on your smartphone</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid harsh lighting for outdoor shots and get ambient lighting for indoor shots</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn how to use post production software like iMovie or Windows Movie Maker</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before posting your videos, make sure that you have specified the appropriate category, and included keywords in the description to target your local audience. This will help your videos rank both in YouTube and Google search results.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/thecarolinasfinest/videos"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-53615" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/YouTube_Jessica-Riffle-Edwards.png" alt="YoutTube screenshot Jessica Edwards" width="1346" height="704" /></a></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jessica Edward’s YouTube channel has almost 12,000 subscribers. Her videos include answers to common real estate questions and some listings.</span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Source: www.youtube.com/user/thecarolinasfinest/videos</span></i></p>
<h3><b>2. Pinterest</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is more to using Pinterest for real estate leads than pinning your listings. It’s all about the strategy &#8211; what kinds of photos you share, which groups you join, the quality of your pins, and how you stand out. First, make sure that you’ve joined the best real estate group boards on Pinterest. You can learn from veteran agents on the board how to create unique postings that stand out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diversify your pins to appeal to prospective clients &#8212; don’t post only listings all the time. In fact, listings should make up only about 10 % of all your pins. Ideas for other boards besides listings include an interior design board, a home improvement board, or a gardening board to appeal to a broader audience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When pinning something to your account, take the time to fill out the description, with a focus on local keywords (e.g. Williamsburg Brooklyn boutique condo) to get leads in your farm area, and then edit the pin to add your website’s URL. A number of leads get lost on Pinterest when they are left without information or a way to find out more about a photo.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-53611" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/PIN_Denise-Robinson.png" alt="Pinterest Screenshot Denise Robinson" width="830" height="660" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Denise Robinson’s Pinterest account has over 40,000 followers. She has 133 boards for categories like real estate selling and buyer tips, interior design, and listings.<br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Source: www.pinterest.com/DeniseRobinsonRE/</span></i></p>
<h3><b>3. Facebook </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there’s only one social media platform that you choose to leverage, it should be Facebook, the largest social media site with over </span><a href="https://www.dreamgrow.com/top-15-most-popular-social-networking-sites/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2 billion users</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can market to prospective clients on Facebook for free. The first step is creating a Facebook business page if you don’t already have one. Once you do, you can start posting content that people in your farm area will find useful such as local market updates, neighborhood news, and restaurant reviews. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another good strategy is to choose a frequently shared real estate article online, rewrite it (and improve on it) and post in on your website, and then share your rewritten article in multiple relevant Facebook groups. Just remember&#8211;keep your listings down to around 10 percent of all your posts. People come to Facebook to relax, not get sold to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also use Facebook Advertising to target specific types of leads. For example, if the majority of your clients are parents aged 30-40, you can use Facebook’s ad platform so that only people fitting this profile will see your posts. Facebook also allows retargeting, meaning you can make your ads visible only to Facebook users who have already visited your website.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/blancasaldana/"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-53605" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/FB_Blanca-Saldana-Realtor.png" alt="Facebook Screenshot Blanca Saldana" width="837" height="635" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from listings, Blanca Saldana’s Facebook page is filled with useful information like this &#8211; Mortgage Myths Busted in 90 seconds.<br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Source: www.facebook.com/blancasaldana/</span></i></p>
<h3><b>4. LinkedIn</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many real estate professionals aren’t leveraging LinkedIn for lead generation. This is probably because this social media platform serves more of a professional purpose than a social one. People don’t come to LinkedIn to comment on friends’ posts or to browse photos. They come to LinkedIn to search for people in their network, and this is what real estate agents should focus on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Build your network by consistently sending connection requests weekly to former clients or other agents and by joining local groups. Being able to establish a good network can generate referrals and even potential clients from your second and third degree connections. Once you have a solid network, start posting articles that provide helpful information such as industry trends or explaining a particular real estate concept. You can also post, on occasion, your accomplishments or milestones (e.g. 100th property sold). These types of posts will not only build your reputation, but also emphasize your expertise as well. By the time someone among your connections needs a realtor’s services, or wants to recommend a realtor to someone, your name will be top of mind.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/jillepsteinhomes"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-53609" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/LI_Jill-Epsein-Homes.png" alt="LinkedIn screenshot Jill Epstein" width="879" height="667" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Posting useful information like industry trends help build your reputation and increase your connections, as you can see from Jill Epstein’s profile.<br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Source: www.linkedin.com/in/jillepsteinhomes</span></i></p>
<h3><b>5. Instagram</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of September 2017, Instagram has reached an average of </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/25/how-many-users-does-instagram-have-now-800-million.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">800 million monthly active users</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, something that real estate agents should capitalize on. Real estate lends itself very nicely to Instagram because it&#8217;s such a visual medium. You can post photos or videos of listings you’ve  sold or interesting places in your farm area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also update your Instagram account with photos of your recent wins and, when possible, post testimonials from your clients to boost your reputation. Stay on top of the most relevant and popular hashtags specific to your farm area so people can find your posts. Hashtags work similarly to long-tail keywords you use for your website’s SEO. Use these hashtags on your posts but remember not to overdo them to avoid drowning the link to your blog or website.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.instagram.com/realtorsterling/"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-53607" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IG_Realtor-Sterling.png" alt="Instagram screenshot @realtorsterling" width="891" height="597" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Realtor Sterling’s Instagram account has over 17,000 followers. The photos mostly consist of sold listings with hashtags appropriate for its farm area.<br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Source: www.instagram.com/realtorsterling/</span></i></p>
<h3><b>6. Twitter</b></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.omnicoreagency.com/twitter-statistics/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">328 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; that’s the number of active monthly users on twitter as of August 2017. The first way to take advantage of this and get the best leads is to follow major real estate professionals in your area. See what kinds of things they are tweeting, and retweet current and informative news in your niche to keep your followers interested. Try to get involved in as many discussions as you can, offering insight and professional advice to establish your reputation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter advertising (Promoted tweets, Promoted trends, Promoted accounts) can also work well once you’ve gotten hold of a solid number of followers, as a sizable amount of retweets, likes and favorites can generate leads. Promoted tweets allows you to purchase advertising space around a popular hashtag which have been proven effective on Twitter. Using promoted tweets brings your content to the top of relevant search results, while a promoted account lands your Twitter account among the “who to follow” lists. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.twitter.com/Ryan_DeMent"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-53613" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Twitter_Ryan-DeMent.png" alt="Twitter screenshot Ryan DeMent" width="923" height="646" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryan DeMent’s twitter account has quite the number of followers and most of his posts are useful information for sellers, buyers and real estate agents.<br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Source: www.twitter.com/Ryan_DeMent</span></i></p>
<h2><b>Pro Tip</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve committed to using these social media platforms to get more real estate leads, the next challenge is to manage all of it simultaneously. A social media management program, like </span><a href="https://hootsuite.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hootsuite</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, lets you schedule posts in advance, monitor your audience’s interaction, and generate reports to help you run your social campaigns on different platforms without fail.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without a doubt, social media platforms are among the most powerful channels for real estate agents to get leads. So if you’re missing out on any of those listed above, it’s probably time to roll up your sleeves and give your business a social media boost.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>LinkedIn, the professional networking site, reached <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/24/linkedin-hits-500m-member-milestone-for-its-social-network-for-the-working-world/">500 million users</a> in April 2017, 135 million of which are active users within the United States, but what does that mean for real estate professionals?</p>
<p>It means there is a huge opportunity to network, connect, and impress people on LinkedIn – peers and prospects alike.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/246176/share-of-us-internet-users-who-use-linkedin-by-household-income/">Statista</a>, 77 percent of people in the U.S. on LinkedIn make over $50,000 a year, 45 percent of which bring in over $75,000. Paired with the fact that the typical home seller has a median household income of $100,700 (<a href="https://www.nar.realtor/field-guides/field-guide-to-quick-real-estate-statistics">NAR</a>, 2015), LinkedIn&#8217;s users are likely to be potential home buyers and sellers.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>There are 104 million people in the U.S. who are active on LinkedIn and make over $50,000 annually, 58 percent of which make more than $75,000<em>. </em></h4>
</blockquote>
<p>If the stats aren’t convincing enough, let’s dig into the theoretical potential that LinkedIn has to offer real estate agents.</p>
<h3><strong>LinkedIn for networking</strong></h3>
<p>As an industry that relies almost exclusively on relationships, it’s important for agents to cultivate a network of industry professionals to support each other and their business.</p>
<p>This can be accomplished in the following two ways:</p>
<p><u>Reconnect</u>: A great place to start building your LinkedIn network is by reconnecting with former colleagues, professional acquaintances, and fellow alumni from college.</p>
<p><u>Groups</u>: There are over 1.5 million professional groups on LinkedIn that were created for the purpose of connecting with like-minded professionals and sharing industry resources.</p>
<p>A few real estate groups worth mentioning:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/118487/profile">Real Estate Professionals Referral Group</a> (117,821 members)<br />
“Referral network group for real estate professionals around the country and world. The group’s purpose is to provide a source for real estate professionals when they have a client moving outside of their area who needs a great real estate agent. Since real estate is local, we allow local service providers who value referrals from other agents to also participate in the group.****Please do not post listings, local information or sales pitches here…”</li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/134657/profile">Real Estate Professionals Group</a> (88,291 members)<br />
“This group is exclusively for real estate professionals who follow the highest ethics and standards. Members are interested in educating consumers and other real estate professionals with their knowledge. The group is not for personal promotion.”</li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/59/profile">Inman – Smart About Real Estate</a> Group (86,133 members)<br />
“The purpose of this group is to promote greater networking within the real estate industry. Our hopes are that you can use this group as a tool to expand and grow your sphere of contacts. We do ask that you refrain from posting your listings or marketing your products… spam free environment.”</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ve likely noticed a common condition for group membership – No spam, personal promotion or marketing permitted. Groups offer a platform for building connections and sharing resources, not pitching sales. Always respect your audience.</p>
<h3><strong>LinkedIn as a resource</strong></h3>
<p>Aside from the resources that can be found in groups, LinkedIn can be a valuable resource for anyone looking for professional information or development.</p>
<p>71 percent of professionals view LinkedIn as a credible source for professional information. As a professional networking site, whose primary contributors are professionals, it&#8217;s a great place to discover real estate news, reports, and insights. Find industry professionals whose content you appreciate and follow them to customize the feed on your homepage. LinkedIn users and influencers also tend to appreciate engagement more than other social platforms, like Twitter, where the average half-life of a post is 16 minutes. LinkedIn posts often garner engagement for days, meaning you&#8217;re much more likely to be seen and heard by your network.</p>
<p>In addition to the wealth of robust articles published everyday, LinkedIn recently launched <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/">LinkedIn Learning</a>, a new digital learning platform designed to help professionals discover and develop their skills through personalized, data-driven experiences. The platform offers courses in real estate photography, sales, marketing, leadership, professional development, and pretty much any other skill you&#8217;d like to explore.</p>
<h3><strong>LinkedIn as a source of new leads</strong></h3>
<p>It’s important to mention that no social platform should be viewed as an individual source of new leads, but as one element of a lead generating ecosystem, if you will. Your lead sources should always be diversified and supplemental of each other. If you’re not sure what your lead mix should look like, our <a href="http://www.marketleader.com/leadcalculator/">Lead Calculator</a> can help you.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Collect Recommendations</span>: LinkedIn is a great place to collect recommendations from colleagues, past clients and professional acquaintances. Showcasing these testimonials is a great way to boast, without having to boast. In addition to highlighting the benefits of working with you, your recommendations are likely to garner referral business and impress any prospects who might be researching your business.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cultivate an audience:</span> Do you have a blog that you publish content on? Share your content on LinkedIn to grow your audience, drive traffic back to your website, and build credibility in your network. The more value and unique insights into your local market you can offer your network, the better your content will fare.</p>
<p>Your content on LinkedIn should align with two goals: :</p>
<ol>
<li>Demonstrate expertise.</li>
<li>Provide value to your network, real estate professionals and prospects alike.</li>
</ol>
<p>Because LinkedIn is a professional platform, levels of trust are higher and consumers are more influenced by their professional networks (<a href="https://business.linkedin.com/content/dam/business/marketing-solutions/global/en_US/campaigns/pdfs/b2c-research-ebook-us.pdf">LinkedIn</a>, 2014). Using the site as a platform to publish and distribute valuable content means increased equity, which earns you the trust of both your peers and prospects.</p>
<p>Real estate agents who take the time to craft a LinkedIn profile with a strong network and valuable content only serve to cultivate a holistic online presence. If your LinkedIn profile provides value to the professional community, lead generation will be but a subsequent byproduct of your efforts.</p>
<p>Users on LinkedIn have nearly <a href="https://business.linkedin.com/content/dam/business/marketing-solutions/global/en_US/campaigns/pdfs/b2c-research-ebook-us.pdf">twice as much</a> buying power than those on Facebook and, while LinkedIn might not be a lead-generating machine, there is much promise.</p>
<p>If you build the network, the leads will come.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/is-linkedin-worth-your-time/">Is LinkedIn Worth Your Time?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #000000;">One of the best things about social media is finding a platform that works for you and allows you to engage with your audience in your own way. Find the channel that&#8217;s best for you and the messages you want to share with your clients and master it. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We’ve rounded up a handful of real estate-specific profiles worth a follow that do a great job offering valuable content, captivating images, convey a great brand story, or all of the above. Each social media channel offers something different, as do the profiles we&#8217;re highlighting.</span></p>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Instagram</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">One of the trickiest social channels for real estate, Instagram is nearly 100% visual. Whether you’re posting images, videos or &#8211; if you’re an IG pro &#8211; live stories, your feed is held to different standards than most other channels. Visuals on Instagram must always be clean, authentic and be able to communicate your brand story. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>1. National Association of REALTORS® <span style="color: #3366bb;"><a style="color: #3366bb;" href="https://www.instagram.com/narresearch/">@narresearch</a></span></strong><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright  wp-image-28151" title="Social media for real estate agents" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/social-media-fo-real-estate-agents-300x200.jpg" alt="Essential social media strategies for real estate agents" width="240" height="160" />If you are a real estate agent and are unfamiliar with or reluctant to use social media, forget about advanced social media strategies like crafting “rich pins” for Pinterest or creating listing videos for YouTube.</p>
<p>This is a list of three critical social media strategies that you &#8211; and every other agent &#8211; should participate in. Beyond offering the best of social media’s low-hanging fruit, these strategies have the added bonus of taking up very little time &#8211; you could implement all three of them in an hour or less.</p>
<h2>Create a Business Page on Facebook</h2>
<p>The popularity of Facebook means that potential clients are likely to look up an agent on that social network first, perhaps even before their business website. On Facebook, it’s important for agents to not just leave potential clients with a good first impression, which the professionalism of a business page is far more likely to do than a personal profile, but also to provide pertinent business-related information. So, even though most agents already have personal Facebook profiles, it’s advisable for them to have business pages as well.</p>
<p>Agents can greatly benefit from the functionality that Facebook business pages have (and personal profiles lack):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reviews:</strong> Past clients can review an agent by giving him up to a 5-star rating and writing a note about their experience with the agent.</li>
<li><strong>Likes:</strong> Consumers can be confident that agents with hundreds or thousands of likes on their Facebook business pages have spent a significant amount of time in the industry and have closed many deals, resulting in many past clients who were happy with the agents’ services.</li>
<li><strong>Hours:</strong> Agents can list the times they are in the office or available to take calls on their business pages.</li>
<li><strong>Tabs:</strong> Tabs are customizable boxes located at the top of business pages that agents can use to link to their reviews, photos shared on a business page, personal websites, events, and other social media accounts (to name just a few).</li>
<li><strong>Post comments and pictures:</strong> Past, present and future clients can post comments and pictures directly to the walls of business pages, allowing agents and other consumers to view them. Consumers are not able to do this on agents’ personal profiles unless they are already friends!</li>
<li><strong>General business information:</strong> Business pages have special areas where agents can provide information about various components of their businesses. These include their mission statements, franchise affiliations, and descriptions of their companies.</li>
<li><strong>Map:</strong> The “Info” section of Facebook business pages shows the office address on a map. This feature makes it easy for potential clients to determine their proximity to an agent, or the agent’s distance from the homes they want to buy or sell.</li>
<li>While personal profiles have places for users to enter their <strong>email addresses, phone numbers, websites and mailing addresses</strong>, it’s easier to find all four in the “Info” section of Facebook business pages.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>See below for an example of the level of detail every real estate agent&#8217;s &#8220;Info&#8221; page on their Facebook business page should have. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ChicoRealEstate/info">Click here</a> if you would like to view this agent&#8217;s business page.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-28201" title="Proper Facebook info page 2" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Proper-Facebook-info-page-2.png" alt="" width="600" height="454" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Beyond functionality, Facebook business pages offer agents privacy. Even the most professional agents may eventually have elements of their lives (e.g., pictures from a rowdy trip to Vegas) that they would prefer not to share with potential, current and past clients. Having a business page allows agents to separate their personal lives from their work.</p>
<p>But simply having a Facebook business page is not enough! Make sure that any links from your website or your brokerage’s site go to your business page and not your personal profile.</p>
<h2>Put Contact Info Everywhere … EVERYWHERE</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-28161" title="Real estate agent contact information" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/real-estate-agent-contact-information-300x168.jpg" alt="Real estate agents should put their contact information in obvious places on all their social media" width="300" height="168" />If someone unfamiliar with your social media pages (or, for that matter, your website) had 10 seconds to find your contact information listed on them, would they be able to? Potential clients don’t want to participate in scavenger hunts across your social media pages and website; they are likely to leave your pages to find another agent if they can’t find your contact information within seconds.</p>
<p>(If the answer to the above question was, “No, because I don’t have my contact info listed on my social media pages,” do yourself a favor and add your contact information to them <em>immediately</em>.)</p>
<p>Think of it this way: Not having your contact information listed in an easy-to-find location on your social media pages &#8211; and especially on your business website &#8211; could lose you thousands in commission income from potential clients working with competitors whose contact information is more readily accessible. This is a hefty price to pay for not taking the couple of minutes required to fix this problem!</p>
<p>You can ensure that no potential client will be left wondering how to contact you if you list your phone number and email address in the following locations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Facebook business page:</strong> Contact information is presented both on the main and “Info” pages &#8211; so agents should list it there as opposed to making consumers navigate to their business websites to find it.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter page:</strong> As with your Facebook business page, don’t rely on Twitter users to click on the link to your website to find your contact information! Your Twitter “bio,” the 140 character space where you describe yourself and your business, should have room for your email address and, at the very least, your phone number (the latter will only take up a measly 12 characters).</li>
<li><strong>Google Plus page:</strong> The “Contact Information” box has a space for both your work email address and phone number, so provide both! For extra visibility, you may want to add your contact information in a visible place in your account’s “Story” box.</li>
<li><strong>Business website:</strong> In addition to plainly printing your phone number, email address, and mailing address on your website’s “Contact” page, your phone number should be listed in a highly visible location on the homepage and in the navigation bar or side rail as well.</li>
</ul>
<div><em>An example of how unobtrusive it is to include your phone number in your Twitter bio:</em></div>
<div><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28121" title="Proper Twitter bio with contact info" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Proper-Twitter-bio-with-contact-info.png" alt="A real estate agent's Twitter bio with their phone number listed in it." width="508" height="220" /></div>
<h2>Set Up Google Authorship on Your Blog</h2>
<p>Imagine you are a librarian working at your local public library. Someone interested in the American Civil War approaches you and asks what books on that topic you would recommend. The Civil War is a popular topic and the library has many books on that subject, so your recommendation will have a big influence on this individual’s choice.</p>
<p>For this example, we’ll say the librarian has just two options. Do you recommend the book that has keywords like “American Civil War” and “Gettysburg” found throughout its body content, chapter titles, subheadings and so on? Or do you recommend the book that does not have as many strategically placed keywords but was written by a prominent historian whose work dozens of other library patrons have expressed appreciation for?</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-28171" title="Google logo" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Google-logo-300x107.png" alt="Courtesy of Google" width="300" height="107" />This is the dilemma Google and other search engines have whenever a user submits a query. Their job is to return the most applicable and interesting materials to their users. Otherwise, their users will switch to another search engine better able to find the content they want!</p>
<p>One way that Google gauges Web content quality is by assessing the skill and popularity of its authors. Google can be confident that its users are more likely to appreciate an article by an author whose writing is frequently featured on reputable news sources and garners sizable social interactions (from comments, Facebook likes and Google Plus +1s).</p>
<p>So how is Google able to know what content is written by what author? The answer is a Google Plus feature (and arguably the best reason to use that social network at the moment) called “Google Authorship.” Any real estate agent with a blog can easily claim their posts via Authorship by directing a link from their Google Plus profile to their blog and vice versa.</p>
<p>It is important for agents to set up Authorship because claiming their well-written and highly shared blog posts will boost their “Author Rank,” the metric Google uses to measure the skill and popularity of authors. Furthermore, it’s important for agents to get a leg up on their competition by building their Author Rank now before less-prepared authors across the real estate industry scramble to boost theirs.</p>
<p>If you’re skeptical about the importance of Authorship and Author Rank, know that search engine optimization (SEO) and content marketing experts believe it is the next big topic for their respective fields.</p>
<p>A guide to the simple Google Authorship setup process can be found <a href="https://plus.google.com/authorship">here</a>. An explanation of how authors can build up their Author Rank can be found <a href="http://www.business2community.com/infographics/author-rank-building-machine-animated-infographic-0780922#!BVVK0">here</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-25461" title="Should Real Estate Agents use Instagram for Marketing?" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Fotolia_54740429_XS-300x300.jpg" alt="Instagram has a large number of users, but they may not be the target audience for real estate agents who want to use social media as a marketing tool" width="300" height="300" />Quick! What comes to mind when we say “social media”? Facebook and Twitter, right? Those are the go-to sites for most agents looking to promote their real estate businesses via social media. But promoting a real estate business and marketing listings require two different sets of parameters, which is why many agents use online photo and video sharing sites as well.</p>
<p>The two most popular of these platforms are Pinterest and Instagram. With Facebook’s purchase of the latter almost two years in the rearview mirror, let’s take a look at where Instagram is today and whether it’s worth your consideration as a means to promote both yourself and your listings.</p>
<h2>Diversify Your Social Media</h2>
<p>Although using just one social media platform does not make an effective online campaign, more than two may be too distracting, according to some social media experts. Agents have a finite amount of time every day, and for those who lack assistance, the job of posting to the sites can become overwhelming.</p>
<p>The careful choice of a second platform, then, becomes imperative. Agents want – and clients expect them – to promote their listings online. While Facebook is great for getting the word out about open houses and interesting listing tidbits, an over-reliance on pushing your listings there will do nothing but reduce your number of friends.</p>
<p>It only makes sense, then, that agents seeking to branch out from the standard social media platforms in their quest to compete for market share typically consider adding an online photo and video sharing site to the mix. The most popular of these sites is YouTube, followed closely by Instagram and Pinterest.</p>
<h2>The Allure of Instagram</h2>
<p>Within two months of its birth in 2010, Instagram had grown to 1 million users, and in less than one year that number grew to 10 million. In April of 2012 <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog">Facebook acquired Instagram</a> for $1 billion in cash and stock.</p>
<p>With a reach today of 150 million active monthly users, at first blush, Instagram looks mighty attractive. Add in the fact that <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3001670/instagram-now-bigger-twitter-us-mobiles">Instagram surpassed Twitter</a> last year in mobile users and you’ll find it being touted by real estate advisors all over the Internet.</p>
<p>What’s not to like? Agents can upload photos and videos and connect their Instagram accounts to Facebook and other social networking platforms. One feature, in particular, has many agents scrambling to get an Instagram page: Instagram Direct. This allows the agent to send photos to a predetermined group of users, such as buyers, rather than making available to all.</p>
<p>Overall, so far, Instagram appears custom-made for real estate agents.</p>
<h2>Is It Worth Your Time?</h2>
<p>Before adding anything to a marketing plan, agents need to dig deeper than learning the quantity of visits a site receives. After all, it’s the quality that counts. When one sticks that shovel into the ground next to Instagram, here’s what is dug up: “We find that Instagram is largely made up of urban, youthful (18 to 34) demographics,” says <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-demographics-2013-12">Business Insider’s</a> Cooper Smith.</p>
<p>Instagram’s actual demographics look like this, according to Pew Internet’s 2013 research:</p>
<ul>
<li>The majority of Instagram users are between the ages of 18 and 29. In fact, twice as many users fall into that age group as the next largest group, 30 to 49 year olds (18 percent).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The majority of Instagram users make less than $49,999 a year. Most make less than $30,000.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Most users are city dwellers.</li>
</ul>
<p>These statistics are great news if you’re selling Michael Jordan sneakers or iTunes. But you’re selling houses, and your typical buyer, according to NAR’s 2013 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers, is 49 years old and makes $83,300. Your first-time homebuyer pool has a median household income of $64,400.</p>
<p>Clearly, Instagram users are not a real estate agent’s target audience.</p>
<h2>The Alternative</h2>
<p>If you’re looking for a photo-sharing platform, Pinterest hits a more desirable real estate audience than Instagram.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pinterest has a larger overall share of Internet users than Instagram – 21 percent versus 18 percent.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Most Pinterest users are 30 to 49 years old.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Pinterest’s highest user pool comes from those earning in excess of $75,000 a year &#8211; the same income as the average Facebook user, and closest to the average income of a real estate consumer.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>More Pinterest users live in the suburbs than the inner city, making it more likely that they own a home, thus providing a larger pool of possible sellers.</li>
</ul>
<p>From the demographics alone, it appears that Pinterest is the logical choice for an agent seeking a photo and video sharing platform to add to the social media mix. If you’ve never used the site, NAR has a list of helpful articles on how to get started and how to use Pinterest effectively.</p>
<p>Social media site demographics change over time. Remember, Facebook used to be a mecca for teenagers. Keep an eye on Instagram because it, too, may change enough to be worthy of inclusion in your marketing plan. Until then, it appears to be a waste of time and energy for real estate agents.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/is-instagram-worth-your-time/">Is Instagram Worth Your Time?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Building your brand across various social media platforms has many advantages to your business. As a real estate agent, it&#8217;s important to get your listings out to as many people as possible. Also, it&#8217;s important that people know where they can find you so they can look up information about your company, consider the services you offer, and find a way to contact you.</p>
<p>With that said, here are six Realtor® branding tips every agent should take to heart in order to build a prominent brand across a variety of social media platforms.</p>
<h2>Connect to Your Potential Clients Through Facebook</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-20231" title="Social media branding for Realtors" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/social-media-for-realtors-217x300.jpg" alt="Realtors can use social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter to brand themselves" width="217" height="300" />Facebook is a great tool for real estate agents. Whether you reach out to family and friends to get referrals or connect to potential clients, Facebook is perfect for expanding your network. When using Facebook, it&#8217;s important not to come across as too much of a salesperson. <strong>Instead of forcing yourself on potential clients by bombarding them with Facebook messages about your business, take part in natural conversations and let those conversations lead into the services you offer.</strong></p>
<p>Never post status messages like, &#8220;I&#8217;m taking new clients, so call me now.&#8221; Instead, take the &#8220;top of mind/awareness&#8221; approach by posting, &#8220;I&#8217;m grateful to have so many great clients.&#8221; You could also post pictures of your home listings with comments like, &#8220;Super excited about this new house – could you live here?&#8221; Whatever the case, remain strategic and consider how your audience perceives you.</p>
<p>As far as networking goes, make sure to tag your sellers in the home pictures you post on your Facebook page. This is a great way to open yourself to their networks. Also, try posting messages directly on your seller’s wall so other people can see who you are. Anyone who&#8217;s interested will add you to their list.</p>
<p>Depending on your strategy (branding your business vs. branding yourself), it might be best if you <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/5492/how-to-create-a-facebook-business-page-in-5-simple-steps-with-video.aspx">set up a business page</a> in addition to your personal account. You&#8217;ll be able to use it for posts more directly associated with selling homes. However, keep in mind that you don&#8217;t want to be too sales-oriented here either. <strong>Offer information that&#8217;s engaging and useful, and the sales are more likely to follow.</strong></p>

<h2>Promote Yourself Through YouTube</h2>
<p>YouTube is often overlooked when it comes to social media networks because it isn&#8217;t like the other more traditional platforms. To attract more business, simply start filming all of your home listings and post them on your YouTube account. When filming and posting the videos, be sure to highlight any details of the home listing and use proper keywords to attract potential leads. If done right, people who search Google will run into your YouTube video listings.</p>
<p>When it comes to YouTube, making your video title rich in keywords can be crucial for search engine recognition and possibly even for <a href="https://searchengineland.com/five-keys-for-creating-viral-youtube-titles-37989">making it go viral</a>. For example, if your listing is in New York, make your title &#8220;New York Real Estate – (insert listing address).&#8221; This will drive more traffic to your website and boost your ranking within Google search results.</p>
<p><em>Here&#8217;s an excellent example of how an agent can brand themselves in a unique way and market their services all while having fun and entertaining potential clients:</em><br />

<h2>Reach Locals via Twitter</h2>
<p>Although time-consuming, Twitter works well if you&#8217;re trying to reach a local audience. In order to reach a sufficiently broad local audience, you need to get followers!</p>
<p>To build a healthy following of locals, look at who is following your local celebrities, radio DJs, restaurants, Rotary clubs, and any other personalities or organizations in your city. These types of profiles will almost always have a local following of people. Once you&#8217;ve found the locals, follow them.<strong> Following locals on Twitter that you haven&#8217;t met in real life amounts to a virtual handshake &#8211; and gives you the opportunity to have your brand make an impression on them!</strong></p>
<p>Once the person has noticed that you&#8217;ve followed them, they&#8217;ll likely click on your profile and website to see who you are. Not only does this bring traffic to your site, but people who see value in your service will start following you, allowing you to expand your network to even more people on Twitter. <a href="https://www.marketingcharts.com/digital-26962">Twitter users also tend to be more engaged with brands</a> than Facebook users, and they&#8217;re more open to making connections with people (and companies) that they don&#8217;t already know.</p>
<p>The below picture is a perfect example of how an agent can use Twitter to connect themselves and brand their business.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-21101" title="Real estate branding on Twitter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Real-estate-agent-Twitter.png" alt="Perfect example of how a Realtor can brand themselves on Twitter" width="557" height="250" /></p>
<h2>Talk With Other Professionals on LinkedIn</h2>
<p>After signing up for LinkedIn, the first thing you should do is optimize your public profile. After that, get active in various groups that are associated with the real estate industry. Additionally, you can start your own group to attract other people in your area. By starting a group or joining one, you increase the chance of referrals.</p>
<p><strong>Not only do you have the ability to contact potential clients through LinkedIn, but you also have access to other professionals within the industry who can point you in the right direction.</strong> Either way, by using LinkedIn, you&#8217;re increasing your brand&#8217;s recognition and expanding your network.</p>
<h2>Drive Online Traffic to Your Blog</h2>
<p>While maintaining an online blog isn&#8217;t a necessity, you should consider hosting one on your site so you have a central hub from which you can create content, and to which you can drive traffic from social media. Having a blog is a great way to not only drive online traffic to a specific place (from your other social media accounts), but to showcase your online marketing efforts as well.</p>
<p>If nothing else, blogs are by far the best places for Realtors with active web presences to publish content.</p>
<h2>Make Social Media Easier With HootSuite</h2>
<p><em>Here&#8217;s a quick introduction to the powerful &#8211; and free &#8211; social media tool called HootSuite:</em></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/t9vs0PfgXsc" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe><br />
