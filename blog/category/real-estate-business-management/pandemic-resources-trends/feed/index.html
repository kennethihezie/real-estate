										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The majority of the country is approaching its third month of a new, post-pandemic normal. Some states are easing shelter-in-place (SIP) orders, while others are extending and restricting even further.</p>
<p>Google searches for “homes for sale” fell over 30% from February to March in the wake of the coronavirus’ entrance to the U.S., the World Health Organization declaring a global pandemic, and inaugural SIP orders. Along with consumer home-search behavior declining, the stock market plummeted and the Federal Reserve slashed mortgage rates in an attempt to stimulate investor activity.</p>
<p>Pre-pandemic consumer search volume for the Real Estate category in 2020 peaked in mid-February at 81 points before falling 46% to 44 points in mid-March, as the effects of COVID began to take a toll.</p>
<p>Understandably, the real estate industry was shaken. Those who witnessed the Great Recession of 2008 are likely plagued by similar encounters with plummeting stocks, threats of corporate bankruptcy and economic collapse. No one could be sure what the future held; whether the spring 2020 seller’s market was lost or if activity would cease entirely.</p>
<p>Despite an uncertain economic outlook, volatile stock market, and over <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf">38 million</a>Americans filing for unemployment benefits in the past nine weeks, the real estate market has already begun to recover.</p>
<p>Consumer search volume for “homes for sale” has now rebounded to <i>above</i> pre-COVID levels. As of May 17th, U.S. search activity in the Real Estate category was continuing to rise and search volume for “homes for sale” has hit 100 points, the highest monthly search volume it’s ever been.</p>
<div id="attachment_58853" style="width: 845px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-58853" class="wp-image-58853 size-full" src="https://www.marketleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GT20200521-Consumer-Search-Volume-Index.png" alt="Google Trends Real Estate Search Volume COVID" width="835" height="503" /><p id="caption-attachment-58853" class="wp-caption-text">Data source: Google Trends</p></div>
<p>Despite a fast-recovering market, agent activity is not rebounding as quickly as consumer search volume and is still down 12-15% from pre-COVID levels.</p>
<p>There is <a href="/blog/real-estate-opportunities-to-seize-during-the-pandemic/">opportunity to be seized</a>.</p>
<p>We surveyed thousands of agents last month to understand what successes they were seeing, what they were doing to engage their markets. We learned a lot. The biggest takeaway from survey responses was this:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>The only agents who aren’t seeing any success right now are those doing nothing.</h3>
</blockquote>
<p><b>To recap, here’s what we learned</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">51% of agents are making care calls regularly and of those agents, 46% are generating new business.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">25% of agents are leveraging social media to stay in touch with their sphere and continue to market their listings; 35% of which are generating new business.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Only 5% of agents are investing in paid <a href="/products/real-estate-leads/">lead generation</a> services, but 75% of them are generating new business.</li>
</ul>
<p>Albeit cautiously, the real estate industry and markets across the country are rebounding. There are less active agents and those who are still active are less productive. The need for consumers to buy and sell real estate is not dependent on your willingness to show up. Transactions will close whether with you or your competition.</p>
<p>The real estate industry is resilient. Those who adapt and innovate to serve their clients in a shifting market are going to reap the rewards long far into a post-pandemic world.</p>
<p>We’ll continue to publish updated information, trends and resources as situations evolve. If you’ve got any successes, strategies or just positive stories to share as they relate to the global environment today – please share! We’d love to feature you and share your story with the industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We surveyed thousands of agents and were able to hear first-hand what’s working across the county and, not surprisingly, what isn’t.</p>
<p>Real estate is a resilient industry. As the responses show, most of you are continuing to invest in your businesses and, in turn, generating new business. In fact, the only agents who aren&#8217;t seeing any success with their efforts through SIP orders, social distancing recommendations, and overall sentiment in the current environment are those doing nothing.</p>
<p>Read that again.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>The only agents who aren’t seeing any success right now are those doing nothing.</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>Responses are categorized as successful if the respondent explicitly referenced new business generated as a direct result from outreach efforts.</p>
<p>The real estate industry is alive and well and you shared amazing insights and success stories!</p>
<h3><strong>Here&#8217;s what we learned</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h6>51% of agents are making care calls regularly and of those agents, 46% are generating new business.</h6>
</li>
<li>
<h6>25% of agents are leveraging social media to stay in touch with their sphere and continue to market their listings; 35% of which are generating new business.</h6>
</li>
<li>
<h6>Only 5% of agents are investing in paid lead generation services, but 75% of them are generating new business.</h6>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Ironically, the highest success rate was the least utilized resource for generating business; a glaring example of <a href="/blog/real-estate-opportunities-to-seize-during-the-pandemic/">opportunities</a> missed. We’ve said this before, and we will continue to say it until we are on the other side of this: this is not the time to sleep on your business. Doubling down on lead generation now will secure your seat at the table when the country rebounds.</p>
<h3>The bottom line: agents who are active and reaching out to their market right now are seeing success.</h3>
<p>Consumers are unsure if and how real estate is being conducted and whether it’s possible to keep moving. They are looking to you and, if not you, other agents in your market for both information and certainty. Show up, whether you have all the answers or not. Maintain your relationships, check in on your sphere and see what happens.</p>
<p>Donny Scott of <a href="https://greatscott.kw.com/great-scott">Great Scott Realty Group</a> in Burleson, TX has generated several new listings and pre-approved buyer leads from his outreach efforts. In addition to making welfare calls and emailing to build relationships, he is posting to his blog and social media with a positive spin.</p>
<p>The country is slowly starting to ease Stay-In-Place (SIP) orders, and, as consumer confidence begins to rebound, real estate agents are met with both an opportunity and an obligation to educate their market.</p>
<p>We recently hosted “<a href="/blog/shift-happens-thriving-in-a-changing-market/">SHIFT HAPPENS: Thriving in a Changing Market</a>” with special guest and powerhouse agent, Aubie Pouncey of KW Pacific NW. Aubie stresses, &#8220;The world is different. We are in a shift. It&#8217;s the <em>market of the moment.&#8221; </em></p>
<p>Aubie’s laurels rest on his ability to dive deep in data from his MLS and distill it in a way that educates his sphere enough to guide them through a decision-making process that is data-driven and puts people at ease.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-58773 alignright" src="https://www.marketleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ML-Quote-Aubie-Pouncey.png" alt="Aubie Pouncey Quote" width="1080" height="1080" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consumer search volume for “homes for sale” has completely rebounded to pre-COVID levels, but agent activity is still down 15% and not rebounding at the same rate as consumers.</p>
<p>We reiterate:<a href="/blog/real-estate-opportunities-to-seize-during-the-pandemic/"> opportunity is out there</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll continue to publish updated information, trends and resources as situations evolve. If you&#8217;ve got any successes, strategies or just positive stories to share as they relate to the global environment today &#8211; please share! We&#8217;d love to feature you and share your story with the industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are two camps of real estate agents today: those sleeping on their business, waiting for the storm to pass, and those who are doubling down, capitalizing on opportunities the current market is presenting.</p>
<p>Over the past month, we’ve been tapping our networks to find out what people’s challenges are, what’s working for them, what’s not, and what agents are seeing in local markets across the country.</p>
<p>It comes as no surprise that the majority of agents and Market Leader customers we’ve spoken to have not experienced dramatic losses. The common thread that seems to tie them all together?</p>
<p><strong>Mindset. </strong></p>
<p>Getting through the COVID crisis with your mind, health, and business in tact comes down to mindset. In life, just as in business, situations like the very one we are in builds resilience and, if you’re approaching it right, presents opportunity.</p>
<p>There is opportunity to grow as others exit the business.</p>
<p>There is opportunity to position yourself as an expert and a resource during a time when consumers need guidance most. “The worse things get, the more value you can add,” <a href="http://justlistedsnohomish.com">Aubie Pouncey</a> of KW Pacific NW put it plainly. “It’s a real estate agent’s job to usher people through challenging times.”</p>
<p>The COVID crisis might have much of the world confined, but it is still turning. The pandemic won’t stop people from needing to buy or sell a home.</p>
<h4>People move out of necessity because of:</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">• Death<br />
• Divorce<br />
• Illness<br />
• Relocation<br />
• Financial hardship<br />
• Right-sizing</p>
<p>And that’s just the short list. Those affected by life events still need to move, and they need the guidance of an agent now more than ever.</p>
<h4>There is opportunity to build out a pipeline now that will:</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Keep your business moving </strong></li>
<li><strong>Boom on the other side of the pandemic</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The reality is buyers and sellers in the market right now are active and, while there might be less of them, they are more serious. You might have to work harder, but the opportunity is there.</p>
<p>And, for those who may have decided to pause their search or pull their listing, continuing to engage with them and make yourself available as a resource during this time will secure their business in the future.</p>
<h3>Your competition is leaving the business.</h3>
<p>Redfin laid of 41% of its agents. Compass laid off over 350 agents. Zillow halted its iBuyer program.<br />
What does this mean for you? A large percentage of your competition is not active in the business and there is market share to be had.</p>
<p>Between the Redfin and Compass layoffs, there are 1700 agents exiting the business right now.</p>
<p>That is opportunity.</p>
<p>iBuyers bought over 53,000 homes in 2019. That’s over 4,400 homes a month. Zillow Offers bought over 1200 properties in the Phoenix area alone last year. That’s 100 properties per month in one market.</p>
<p>Zillow, Redfin, and Opendoor all suspended homebuying in March.</p>
<p>That is opportunity.</p>
<h3>People are still buying homes.</h3>
<p>While some numbers might be down year-over-year, there is still movement markets across the country.</p>
<p>According to NAR, 19% of buyers are still actively searching and determined to buy when they find the right property and 53% are still searching and keeping an eye on the market, but not as actively. And of those still searching, 34% are looking to purchase in the next six months. Only 28% of buyers in the market have decided to stop their search.</p>
<p>That is opportunity.</p>
<h3>People are still selling homes.</h3>
<p>Despite the pandemic, people are still listing &#8211; <em>and selling</em> &#8211; their homes. The process might look different depending on your market and shelter-in-place orders in your state, but transactions are closing.</p>
<p>One Bremerton, WA homeowner <a href="https://www.kitsapsun.com/story/news/2020/04/14/essential-workers-kitsap-real-estate-housing-market-coronavirus-pandemic/2985349001/">listed</a> her home for sale on April 8th, a Wednesday, and accepted one out of eight offers over the following weekend.</p>
<p>JoAnn Bailey, Broker at <a href="https://www.joannbailey.com/">Real Estate Services</a> in Idaho, closed the biggest deal of her career, curbside, on April 6th &#8211; sharing a post on Facebook that went viral and inspired thousands and started the hashtag, “#curbsideclosings.”</p>

<p>There is still a great deal of opportunity to be seized.</p>
<p>Engage your sphere, make yourself available as a resource, position yourself as a trusted expert and guide your community through uncertainty.</p>
<p>You might have to work harder than normal, but your business will thank you.</p>
