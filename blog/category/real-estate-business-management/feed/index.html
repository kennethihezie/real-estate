										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are two ways to approach this.</p>
<p>You could create a real estate business plan to avoid failure. Many agents go that route and find some level of success. There’s nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p>But there’s another way. You could create a business plan, not just because it reduces the risk of failure, but because it maximizes your growth potential.</p>
<p>What follows is an invitation to do just that – to go through the process of refining intentionality, elevating accountability, and igniting motivation so you can be more productive. Year after year.</p>
<p>What if 2023 was the year you generated more leads and closed more deals than ever before? It’s possible. But only if you have a plan to follow.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">The Real Estate Business Plan Checklist</h2>
<p>To provide the big-picture view, here are the action items you’ll need to include in your plan for this year:</p>
<ul class="BlogUL">
<li class="BlogLI">Note learnings from 2022</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Calculate your expenses</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Set goals</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Create a marketing plan</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Develop a system for tracking your progress</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re going to take a close look at each. But if you want to hop on the fast track, download the <a href="#download">2023 Real Estate Business Plan</a> and you can get started right away. This free, interactive guide from Market Leader covers everything on that checklist and more. Plus, you’ll get downloadable templates for calculating expenses, setting goals, planning your marketing, and tracking progress.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">5 Year-End Reflection Questions To Consider</h2>
<p>Sometimes you have to look back before you can move forward. Use the questions below as a way to reflect on last year’s performance so you can identify your business’s strengths, weaknesses, and potential.</p>
<ol class="BlogOL">
<li class="BlogLI">Which aspects of my real estate business <strong>occupied most of my time and attention</strong> last year?</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Which aspects of my business <strong>performed best</strong> last year? (For example, maybe you received many referrals, responded quickly to leads, or executed a strong social media campaign.)</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Based on last year’s performance, which aspects of my business <strong>are most in need of improvement</strong>?</li>
<li class="BlogLI">What are the <strong>top two or three mistakes</strong> I made last year that I need to learn from for 2023?</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>What would “success” look like</strong> specifically for my business in 2023?</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Calculate Your Expenses</h2>
<p>Believe it or not, tracking your expenses is an important prerequisite to maximizing your gross commission income for 2023. If you have the right expense-tracking system in place, you’ll get more of your hard-earned income back at the end of the year.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to track all of your deductible business expenses. You may be surprised to learn about the <a href="https://outfront.kw.com/training/11-tax-deductions-every-real-estate-agent-should-know-about/">many ways you can reduce the amount you owe to the IRS</a>. For example, you might even be eligible to deduct expenses related to software, marketing, advertising, and lead generation. Refer to <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p535.pdf">IRS Publication 535</a> for details and be sure to consult with your CPA or financial advisor so you don’t miss out on any money-saving tips.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Two of the Best Ways to Track Your Expenses</h3>
<ul class="BlogUL">
<li class="BlogLI">Use an app. There are many free and low-cost options that allow you to categorize and track your expenses on the go. For example, check out <a href="https://www.spendee.com/">Spendee</a> or <a href="https://dollarbird.co/">Dollarbird</a>. They’re both simple and user-friendly, and they both have options to get you started for less than $5 per month.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Download the free “Expense Tracker” template in Market Leader’s <a href="#download">2023 Real Estate Business Plan</a>. It provides space for you to calculate your personal living expenses and all of your various business expenses all in one place.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Set Your Real Estate Business Goals</h2>
<p>Start by <strong>identifying your average commission per transaction</strong>. Multiply the <a href="https://www.realtor.com/research/market-trends/">median listing price in your area</a> by your commission percentage rate.</p>
<p>Once you’ve calculated your expenses and you’ve figured out roughly how much you’ll bring in from each transaction, you’ll be informed enough to establish an <strong>attainable income goal for 2023</strong>.</p>
<p>From there you can determine how many transactions you’ll need for the year.</p>
<p>The Formula: A ÷ B = C</p>
<p>A. Your 2023 Income Goal<br />
B. Estimated Commission Per Transaction<br />
C. Transactions Needed for the Year</p>
<p>To drill down even farther, check out Market Leader’s free <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/leadcalculator/">Lead Calculator</a>. Simply punch in the numbers you’re aiming for, and the calculator will tell you how many transactions and leads you’ll need across all lead sources to reach your income goal.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Create a Marketing Plan</h2>
<p>Maybe you’re on your way to “top-performer” status, but you don’t have a great plan for getting more clients and increasing your gross commission income. Or maybe you have a plan, but it’s not working.</p>
<p>Either way, you’ll benefit from learning how to <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/real-estate-marketing-plan/">craft a well-developed real estate marketing plan</a> that’s specifically designed to help you <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/products/real-estate-leads/">generate more leads</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick outline sketch of what that would look like in practical terms.</p>
<ul class="BlogUL">
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Build your brand.</strong> Establish a brand identity that includes a mission statement, vision statement, and a value proposition.</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Define your target market.</strong> You can’t be everything to everyone. If you try, your brand will end up blending in instead of standing out. So take the time to identify who fits within your audience.</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Collect data.</strong> When you’re armed with statistics, analytics, and insights, you’re better able to set goals, track progress, and make your success repeatable. Without data, your marketing efforts are more likely to be a complete gamble, if not a guessing game.</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Get marketing automation tools.</strong> With <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/products/professional-for-agents/">Market Leader Professional</a>, for example, you get a customizable, lead-generating website and a fully integrated CRM. Plus, you can automate new listing alerts and even create newsletters and content pieces like postcards, flyers, and video-enabled mobile-responsive emails.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Track Your Progress</h2>
<p>Why is performance-tracking necessary?</p>
<ul class="BlogUL">
<li class="BlogLI">It’s a way of <strong>holding yourself accountable</strong> to the goals you set.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">It provides you with the <strong>feedback</strong> you need to make strategic adjustments.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">It enables you to create <strong>new benchmarks</strong> for future goals.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">It takes the guesswork out of your <strong>professional self-reflection</strong>.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">It’s the most efficient way to <strong>spot what’s working well and what needs improvement</strong>.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">It helps you <strong>prioritize</strong> and keeps you focused on what matters most.</li>
</ul>
<p>It doesn’t have to be time-consuming and complicated. It can be as easy as creating a basic table in your favorite word processor or spreadsheet software, writing down all of your goals in the left column, and using the rest of the columns to note your performance each month (or week).</p>

<p>Still not sure if you’re ready to take the first step? That’s okay. To give you an idea of what to expect, here’s a sketch of some of the concepts covered in the full guide.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">What Is a Real Estate Marketing Plan?</h2>
<p>A real estate marketing plan is an organized collection of strategies, systems, and schedules that individual agents, teams, and brokerages use to guide their marketing efforts.</p>
<p>Every marketing plan for real estate must incorporate the five essential components listed below.</p>
<p>Which (if any) do you already have in place?</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">A Brand Structure</h3>
<p>If you have a weak brand, you’re more likely to lose focus, disappear in the crowd of competition, and misrepresent who you are as an agent. All of which reduces productivity and hinders your ability to acquire and retain quality leads.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH3">Data &amp; Analytics</h2>
<p>When you’re armed with statistics, analytics, and insights, you’re better able to set goals, track progress, and make your success repeatable. Without data, your marketing efforts are more likely to be a complete gamble, if not a guessing game.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">An Understanding of Consumers’ New Expectations</h3>
<p>Service providers of all kinds are constantly adjusting the way they do business to keep up with changes in technology, tactics, and trends. Are you aware of what prospects and clients expect of you as a real estate agent? If not, you risk falling to the background.</p>
<p>For example, most of today’s consumers expect prompt communication via text message. In a <a href="https://cdn.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/2022-home-buyers-and-sellers-generational-trends-03-23-2022.pdf">2022 report from the National Association of Realtors</a> (NAR), 71% of buyers said it was “important” to receive property information and communication from their agent via text message. Whereas in <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/reports/2015/2015-home-buyer-and-seller-generational-trends-2015-03-11.pdf">2015</a> – just seven years earlier – that figure was only 45%.</p>
<p>Consumers expectations change fast, and you need to keep up.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Social Proof</h3>
<p>Speaking of what consumers want, near the top of the list is authentic proof of your competency, especially in the form of reviews and testimonials. In what ways could you add social proof to your marketing efforts? Common ways for agents include requesting reviews on their Facebook pages or Zillow profiles.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Technology &amp; Tools</h3>
<p>The best real estate marketing plans include a social media strategy, video content, <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/solutions/marketing-automation/">robust marketing automation tools</a>, a <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/solutions/customizable-websites/">customizable real estate website</a>, and a <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/solutions/crm/">fully-integrated CRM</a>. But of course, merely having the right tools won’t be enough. You have to know how to use them.</p>
<p>Learn how. <a style="font-weight: 800;" href="#download">Download our free “2023 Real Estate Marketing Plan”</a> and make today the day you begin taking your business to the next level.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Only SMART Goals Will Produce the Results You Want</h2>
<p>Goal-setting is a crucial part of marketing for real estate agents. And maybe you’ve already established goals, but you’re not seeing the results you want.</p>
<p>The reason may be that they’re not SMART goals: smart, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound.</p>
<p>This approach enables you to set realistic goals while also increasing the likelihood that you’ll actually achieve them.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">3 Examples of SMART Goals</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>“I will increase the average number of leads I generate every month by 20 percent by the end of 2023.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I will attend one webinar or download one guide about lead generation best practices every month throughout 2023.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I will 1) research which real estate website provider has the best websites for generating leads and 2) implement a new website from that provider by the end of the first quarter.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Want a full breakdown of each part of the acronym so you can start setting results-producing goals today? <a style="font-weight: 800;" href="#download">Get our free interactive marketing planning guide.</a></p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">5 Must-Have Real Estate Marketing Strategies</h2>
<p>Goals are worthless if you don’t have specific strategies in place to help you reach them. Think of them as the difference between planning and wishful thinking. They are the “how” to your “what.”</p>
<p>It would be impossible to list <em>all</em> of the many strategies you could implement as part of your marketing plan. Plus, it wouldn’t be very helpful for you to skim through a dizzying array of possibilities. Instead, let’s narrow it down to five real estate marketing ideas that are sure to generate more leads.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Invest in Advertising</h3>
<p>In the <a style="font-weight: 800;" href="#download">“2023 Real Estate Marketing Plan,”</a> not only will you get practical pro tips for advertising, but you’ll also get a customizable budgeting calendar so you can put money where your <em>month</em> is.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Develop a Strategy for Referrals</h3>
<p>Imagine if every one of your former clients referred someone to you every year. That’s totally conceivable, and the success would be compounding – and life-changing! The guide gives you three ideas to jumpstart your referral strategy brainstorming session.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Use Marketing Automation Tools</h3>
<p>The best marketing automation tools do it all. With <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/products/professional-for-agents/">Market Leader Professional</a>, for example, you get a customizable, lead-generating website; a fully-integrated CRM; and the ability to automate new listing alerts, newsletters, and print and digital content pieces like postcards, flyers, and video-enabled mobile-responsive emails.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Leverage the Power of Social Media</h3>
<p>To give you a shortcut for implementing an efficient and productive social media strategy, the <a style="font-weight: 800;" href="#download">“2023 Real Estate Marketing Plan”</a> provides a handy “Social Media Cheat Sheet” so you’ll know the audience, tone, and user intentions applicable for each channel.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Get Exclusive Buyer &amp; Seller Leads Delivered to You Each Month</h3>
<p>Securing a steady stream of exclusive online leads each month cuts down on the time you have to spend on prospecting, while also putting you in a better position to plan for the future. For example, Market Leader offers <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/products/real-estate-leads/">real estate leads</a> which will empower you to reach your sales goals and sidestep the stressful boom-and-bust cycle.</p>
<h2 id="download" class="BlogH2">What Else Is Included in the Guide?</h2>
<p>In addition to all that we alluded to above, the “2023 Real Estate Marketing Plan” also provides the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information about how to build your brand, including your unique value proposition, mission statement, vision statement, and target audience</li>
<li>The “Marketing Audit” worksheet</li>
<li>The “SWOT Analysis” worksheet</li>
<li>The “Digital Marketing Toolkit”</li>
<li>And most importantly, the “Create Your Marketing Plan” worksheet where you can pull it all together to craft a comprehensive, actionable, results-oriented plan of your own to generate more leads than ever before</li>
</ul>
<p>Every big plan starts with a small decision. Will you download Market Leader’s free interactive real estate marketing plan?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To put the bottom line at the top, referral commission for real estate agents is approximately 25% of the gross commission from the applicable side of the transaction.</p>
<p>Why “approximately”? Because there isn’t a standard rate for referral fees (and therefore referral commissions), and they’re negotiable.</p>
<p>You likely have many more questions related to referral fees in real estate. If so, you’re not alone. It can be a complicated topic.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at some of the most frequently asked questions about agent-to-agent referrals.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Why Would I Ever Send Business to Someone Else?</h2>
<p>It’s a fair question. If nothing else, the concept of giving a referral might seem somewhat counterproductive at first. But there are certainly times when a referral is the best option. Here are the most common reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The obvious one first: <strong>You can get a significant portion of the paycheck for doing a small portion of the work</strong>. Of course, you’d probably rather do all of the work and cash in on all of the commission. But there are a few reasons why that may not be possible, which would mean collecting a referral fee is your best option. Here are two examples…</li>
<li><strong>It’s an out-of-market transaction.</strong> Let’s say, for example, a client of yours is looking to buy a home in another state, a state in which you aren’t licensed. You can’t be the one to complete the sale, but you can refer your client to another agent and receive a referral commission on that transaction. Many businesses, like <a href="https://www.referralexchange.com/">ReferralExchange.com</a>, can help you find out-of-state agents to make referrals to.</li>
<li><strong>You’re not qualified to help.</strong> It’s good to have a wide range of expertise. But not every real estate agent is qualified to handle every type of transaction. Sometimes you’re just not a good fit for the job. For example, a residential real estate agent may not be able to work with commercial properties. Rather than stumbling beyond your purview, sometimes it’s best to hand it off to an agent who can provide the help your client needs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="BlogH2">What Is a Fair Real Estate Referral Commission?</h2>
<p>There are two pitfalls to avoid: asking too much and asking too little. If your referral fee is too high, you jeopardize the relationship you have with the other real estate agent. And that could come back to haunt you later when the tables are turned and they choose to refer business to someone else.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if your referral fee is too low, you might be forfeiting the portion of the commission that’s rightfully yours.</p>
<p>So where’s the middle ground?</p>
<p>A good rule of thumb is to stick close to the standard referral fee for real estate agents, which is about <a href="https://www.referralexchange.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ReferralExchange-Report_2017.pdf">25%</a>. Some agents go as high as 50% and some go as low as 20%.</p>
<p>Where you set the rate for your referral fee is completely up to you. As long as you avoid both pitfalls, keep your network happy, and stay open to negotiation, you’ll be on the right track.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Why Should I Seek To Get More Referrals From Agents?</h2>
<p>First, because referral commission in real estate can be lucrative.</p>
<p>How lucrative? It’s difficult to say. But using an example to break down some rough estimates will give you a good idea.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSPUS">current median home sale price</a> in the U.S. is reportedly around $440,300.</li>
<li>Let’s say the total commission (for one side of the transaction) is 5%. Using $440,300 as our example, that would amount to $22,015.</li>
<li>If the commission fee is 25% of $22,015, the referral agent would receive $5,503.75 (before taxes and fees, of course). Not bad for just a moment’s worth of work!</li>
</ul>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/blogs/economists-outlook/sources-of-income-for-real-estate-agents">a recent study from the National Association of Realtors</a> (NAR), the typical Realtor receives approximately one quarter of their income from real estate referral commission (both from consumers and other agents).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.referralexchange.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ReferralExchange-Report_2017.pdf">Another study</a> indicated that outbound referrals “make up a median of 12.5% of total transactions per agent per year.” And if the commission fees are around 25%, that can really add up to a significant amount of income for all agents involved.</p>
<p>Combining data points like these (<a href="https://listwithclever.com/real-estate-blog/realtor-referral-how-do-referral-agents-work-and-get-paid/">and others</a>), it’s not hard to see why agents often lean toward a favorable view of the income-generating power of referral commission.</p>
<p>And another reason to pursue more referrals is because one referral often leads to many more, which can eventually become <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/products/real-estate-leads/">a steady (and passive!) lead generation source</a>. If that piques your interest, be sure to learn <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/5-ways-to-build-a-referral-based-business/">these five ways to build a referral-based business</a>.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Is It Possible To Miss Out on Real Estate Referral Commission?</h2>
<p>Okay fine, this is not a frequently asked question. But maybe it should be. Because the answer is yes. There are two ways to mess up referrals.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Don’t Put It in Writing</h3>
<p>Real estate referral commission deals can get messy for all parties involved without a contract. Not only could it jeopardize the relationship you have with the client and the other agent and brokerage, but the transaction could even be illegal.</p>
<p>Whether you’re giving or receiving referral commission, be sure you have a real estate referral contract written up that documents everything about the transaction. Check out this <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/applications-and-forms/2013/REALTOR-REFERRAL-FORM-F-2013-11-18.pdf">referral contract</a> from the NAR, for example.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Ignore the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA)</h3>
<p>If you’re an agent working in the U.S., you’ll need to abide by the statutes outlined in the RESPA, a law Congress passed in 1974 to protect consumers. It ensures that consumers are always aware of the costs associated with their lone, and it helps to prevent costs from rising for unethical and unnecessary reasons.</p>
<p>Among other provisions, <a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_respa_frequently_asked_questions.pdf">RESPA</a> “prohibits certain actions related to federally related mortgage loans,” including kickbacks and “unearned fee arrangements.”</p>
<p>To summarize the legalese, it means no portion of any real estate referral fees involved in a transaction can make their way to a third party or any person or entity that isn’t a licensed agent. For example, agents can’t abuse the right to add the cost of referral fees to a consumer’s loan so they can pay off insurance companies, appraisers, construction companies, home inspectors, or attorneys for more business.</p>
<p>Want to learn more? Here’s a <a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_respa_frequently_asked_questions.pdf">helpful document that covers the details</a>, and here’s where you can check out the <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/real-estate-settlement-procedures-act-respa/respa-faq">NAR’s RESPA FAQ</a> (wow, that’s a lot of acronyms).</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/referral-commission-for-real-estate-agents/">How Much Is Referral Commission for Real Estate Agents?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are administrative tasks stealing your time away from clients or other important items on your ever-growing to-do list? Maybe it’s time to consider hiring a real estate virtual assistant.</p>
<p>Most successful business executives, CEOs, and industry leaders get plenty of help. They have advertising agencies to handle ads, marketing companies to promote their services, and administrative assistants to handle the details.<br />
But interestingly, real estate agents are notorious for being the opposite. They’re often reluctant to delegate any tasks and seem to prefer to wear all of the hats in their business.<br />
Too many agents wait to get help until they’re completely overwhelmed because they can no longer juggle all of the demands.</p>
<p>The help you get from an assistant may be more than a mere mental health benefit (as good as that is). It can lead to greater levels of productivity overall.</p>
<p>Mark Young (Stouffer Realty, Northeast Ohio), put it this way: “If you are truly running your business like a real business and you are still overwhelmed, you’re leaving too much money on the table by not adding to your team.”</p>
<p>He’s speaking from personal experience. Young’s business saw a rise in income that he says is positively correlated to the number of staff members he adds to his team.</p>
<p>Maybe for you, getting the help you need looks like hiring a virtual assistant. If so, here’s everything you need to know.</p>
<p style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.8; font-weight: 800;">If you’re too busy, you need help.</p>
<p>For top-producing agents, that’s not a new concept.</p>
<p>Las Vegas’s Jared Jones (Horizon Realty Group), who has been at the top of the list of the country’s most productive agents, credits his ability to handle the volume he does to hiring staff members.</p>
<p>Jones says that too many agents have a “lone ranger” attitude, which prevents them from joining the ranks of the top producers.</p>
<p>“If I had to touch every single piece in the system itself,” he said for the <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/housing/two-valley-real-estate-brokers-land-on-top-10-u-s-sales-list/">Las Vegas Review Journal</a>, “I would never be able to produce multiple amounts of volume. You have to be efficient, and you have to leverage the system (by hiring).”</p>
<p>Adding to your team can lead to higher volume. Noted. But does that mean you should get help from a virtual or on-site assistant?</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Advantages of Hiring a Real Estate Virtual Assistant</h2>
<h3 class="BlogH3">They Can Simultaneously Help You Save Money and Generate Growth</h3>
<p>One of the biggest advantages of hiring a freelance real estate virtual assistant over hiring a full-time, in-house employee is the lower cost.</p>
<p>Virtual real estate assistant pricing varies, but to give you an idea of what to expect, <a href="https://www.indeed.com/career/virtual-assistant/salaries/Bellevue--WA?from=top_sb">the median pay for a virtual assistant</a> in the U.S. hovers around $20 per hour. The <a href="https://www.salary.com/research/salary/posting/licensed-real-estate-assistant-salary/bellevue-wa">median salary for an on-site licensed real estate assistant</a>, however, is around $49,000 per year (or about $24 per hour).</p>
<p>That’s a significant difference, especially because going the freelancer route means you avoid having to provide all of the costly benefits that a full-time, on-site staff member would require, including Social Security, medicare, health insurance, retirement, and the rest.</p>
<p>“You’re not paying for my taxes and my insurance, for one thing,” says Kim Hughes, who owns her own real estate virtual assistance firm (<a href="https://www.kimhughes.com/">Kim Hughes &amp; Company</a>). Plus, you won’t have the costs (and headaches) associated with unemployment insurance when it comes time to part ways.</p>
<p>So meanwhile, as you’re saving money, your virtual assistant is enabling you to drive growth and generate a higher income, as both Young and Jones alluded to earlier.</p>
<p>Ryan Schwartz agrees. Looking for ways to build his business, Schwartz (White Sands Realty, Naples, FL) hired a virtual assistant to make website lead callbacks and to manage his database. He quickly saw the advantages.</p>
<p>Delegating some of the more time-consuming tasks of his business freed him up to build his pipeline and drum up new business. In his words: “A virtual assistant enhances my efficiency and effectiveness.”</p>
<p>Combine the help you get from a real estate virtual assistant with a <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/products/professional-for-agents/">customizable website, robust CRM, and the best marketing automation tools</a>, and you’ll be virtually unstoppable (pun intended).</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">A Real Estate Virtual Assistant Can Also Save You Time</h3>
<p>Setting the monetary cost aside, there’s also a time cost associated with training and managing an on-site employee that you don’t have to spend on a virtual assistant in real estate.</p>
<p>Most of the larger, established real estate virtual assistant firms provide fully trained staff members. So, rather than paying a staff member through the learning curve and taking time out of your schedule to train them, firms and freelancers are ready to roll right into your daily schedule.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">6 Common Tasks You Can Delegate to a Virtual Assistant in Real Estate</h3>
<p>Think about how many tasks you currently perform that take you away from focusing your time and energy on more profitable activities.</p>
<p>Getting them off your plate by delegating them to a virtual assistant can move you to the next level in your business and produce a sweet return on investment.</p>
<p>For example, here are some of the kinds of tasks a real estate virtual assistant can take on for you:</p>
<ol>
<li>Administrative tasks, such as scheduling and transaction coordination</li>
<li>Clear the less-complicated emails out of your inbox</li>
<li>Design and manage your website</li>
<li>Manage your social media accounts</li>
<li>Write the copy for your emails, blog content, and marketing materials</li>
<li>Manage your <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/solutions/crm/">CRM</a></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="BlogH2">What If I Don’t Make Enough Money to Hire a Virtual Assistant?</h2>
<p>Popular real estate coaches used to tell agents that they needed to reach a certain income threshold and remain there consistently before even thinking about hiring an assistant.</p>
<p>But there’s a major flaw in that advice. It fails to take into account that all of the time agents spend doing the work an assistant could have been handling was time spent away from performing the very activities that would allow them to consistently reach the income threshold.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the popularity of that advice has waned. Virtual staffing companies and virtual freelancers allow agents the flexibility to schedule as few or as many hours of assistance per week as needed.</p>
<p>And that means you as the agent have to pay an assistant on a contract or per-task basis, rather than handing out paychecks on a regular, continuous schedule.</p>
<p>That’s especially valuable for agents who are just starting out. They can get help when they need it and save money when they don’t.</p>
<p>Rob Chevez (Keller Williams agent from Reston, VA) realized he needed administrative help. But he wasn’t sure if he could afford a full-time employee.</p>
<p>“I needed simple things done,” he said, “like scanning business cards and putting that information into my database. I just needed someone maybe 20 hours a week, in a role that wasn’t client-facing. So I hired a virtual assistant to do that for me.”</p>
<p>According to Chevez, that’s how many agents take their first baby step into the world of virtual workers. And like him, they quickly learn that production increases as they focus on their most important tasks.</p>
<p>“I started getting a lot busier,” he said, which eventually led him to take the bigger step of hiring a full-time assistant – who, like his first one, works virtually from home.</p>
<p>Feeling a little unsure about whether hiring a virtual assistant is the best next step for your business? Maybe start with an intern. <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/real-estate-interns/">Here’s everything you need to know about real estate internships.</a></p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/real-estate-virtual-assistant/">Should I Hire a Real Estate Virtual Assistant?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If there is one thing real estate agents dislike, it’s parting with money. Low or no cost approaches are thus highly treasured, such as the use of social media as a marketing tool and the heavy reliance on do-it-yourself photography.</p>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with being frugal. Even wealthy people know this—many are actually quite thrifty, pinching pennies and living beneath their means. So, in the spirit of helping you hang on to every possible commission dollar, here’s the skinny on hiring an intern.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">What Exactly Is an Intern?</h2>
<p>An intern is a person who works primarily to gain experience in a field. Some work for free. It may sound crazy, but they have their reasons for offering their services without receiving compensation in return.</p>
<p>Most interns are young and usually in college. In fact, around 40 percent of college students work as unpaid interns, according to the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/17/more-than-40percent-of-interns-are-still-unpaidwhy-thats-legal.html">National Association of Colleges and Employers</a>.</p>
<p>If you hope to hire an intern to assist you with various duties for your real estate practice, however, you will most likely need to pay them. (More on that in a minute.)</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">The Duties of a Real Estate Intern</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://realestate.business.uconn.edu/career-opportunities/intern-program/">University of Connecticut School of Business</a> offers a well-structured intern program. While they acknowledge that intern responsibilities will vary from firm to firm, some general duties they suggest include:</p>
<ul class="BlogUL">
<li class="BlogLI">Participating in the preparation of market analyses</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Researching records and real estate statistics</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Attending appraisals, to gain experience in assigning value to real property</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Using the MLS to find properties that match a buyer’s criteria</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Preparing and maintaining lists of FSBO properties and expired listings</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Updating and maintaining your <a href="/solutions/crm/">real estate CRM</a></li>
<li class="BlogLI">Assisting in transaction coordination</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Assisting with the open house process</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Website development and/or maintenance</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Writing copy for ads, your website, and <a href="/solutions/marketing-automation/">email marketing campaigns</a></li>
<li class="BlogLI">Maintaining the agent’s presence on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media accounts</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, the tasks you assign the intern will be based in large part on the intern’s talents, knowledge, experience and what he or she hopes to learn while working with you.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Your Commitment to Your Interns</h2>
<p>Hiring an intern may not be the ideal situation for a time-pinched agent with no staff. Providing a valuable hands-on experience for the intern will require direct training from you or a staff member. Remember, an unpaid intern is trading labor for real-life training and experience.</p>
<p>This might be hard to hear, but if you’re a busy solo agent, you should probably hire an experienced assistant instead, either an in-house or <a href="/blog/is-there-roi-in-virtual-assistants-for-real-estate-agents/">virtual assistant</a>.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Do Real Estate Interns Get Paid?</h2>
<p>Unpaid labor is the dream of many small business owners. Who wouldn’t want someone that comes to work, contributes to the business, and expects nothing in return except the ability to gain knowledge and experience?</p>
<p>It doesn’t quite work that way, however. There are legal requirements for unpaid internships that you must follow if you want to hire someone who will work for free. And, similarly, there are federal laws you must follow if you hire a paid intern.</p>
<p>Federal guidelines clearly define what you must do if you hope to hire unpaid interns. In fact, there are <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/71-flsa-internships">six criteria</a>, and you must abide by all of them, otherwise the intern will be considered an employee.</p>
<p>To hire an unpaid intern, all of the following must apply:</p>
<ol class="BlogOL">
<li class="BlogLI">You must provide an educational environment. This means that the training you supply must be similar to what the intern would receive at a vocational school or academic institution.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">What the intern experiences must directly benefit him or her. The law requires that “the intern does not perform the routine work of the business on a regular and recurring basis, and the business is not dependent upon the work of the intern.”</li>
<li class="BlogLI">The intern is not hired as a replacement for a regular employee, “but works under close supervision of existing staff.”</li>
<li class="BlogLI">You do not derive an advantage from the intern’s work. The guidelines even go on to say that, on occasion, the business’s operations “may actually be impeded” by the intern’s activities. The law states that if the intern is performing routine productive work, such as filing or other clerical work or assisting customers, “then the fact that they may be receiving some benefits in the form of a new skill or improved work habits will not exclude them from the Fair Labor Standards Act’s (FLSA) minimum wage and overtime requirements, because the employer benefits from the interns’ work.”</li>
<li class="BlogLI">The internship is for a fixed period, and there is no expectation that the intern will be given a job after the internship is completed. Otherwise, it appears that you are hiring unpaid interns for a trial period, after which you will hire them permanently—a condition the FLSA considers employment.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">There is an understanding between you and the intern that he or she is not entitled to wages for the work performed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Number four will be the clincher for most real estate agents. After all, the whole idea of hiring an intern for a real estate practice is to get some help with routine business tasks.</p>
<p>That brings us to a more likely scenario: hiring a paid intern. This creates an employment relationship, with the attendant <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2013/04/19/6-legal-requirements-for-unpaid-internship-programs/?sh=71c0ca8f6bf1">responsibilities</a> for worker’s compensation, employee benefits, discrimination laws, state labor laws and unemployment insurance coverage. Agents who require assistance with the day-to-day tasks of running their business rarely have time to deal with the intricacies of hiring and paying employees.</p>
<p>Assuming that you still want to hire an intern: Think it’s okay to pay minimum wage? Think again, oh frugal real estate agent. The average hourly wage for interns at the bachelor’s degree level is $15.07 in 2022, <a href="https://www.ziprecruiter.com/Salaries/Intern-Salary-per-Hour">according to ZipRecruiter</a>.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Where to Find Real Estate Internships</h2>
<p>You can find interns looking for work at local colleges and universities. An ad on Craigslist will most likely pique some interest as well, especially if it’s a paid internship.</p>
<p>Finally, online sites such as <a href="https://www.internships.com/employer/resources/recruit">Internships.com</a> accept recruitment posts.</p>
<p>Internships may seem like an easy way to get free or cheap labor. However, the federal government—and the interns themselves—feel otherwise. If you truly require help, but lack the funds to hire an assistant, consider a piecemeal approach. Outsource your marketing, writing or database tasks. Even one duty taken off your plate frees up time for you to spend on more important aspects of your business.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/real-estate-interns/">Real Estate Internships—What to Know Before You Hire</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The majority of the country is approaching its third month of a new, post-pandemic normal. Some states are easing shelter-in-place (SIP) orders, while others are extending and restricting even further.</p>
<p>Google searches for “homes for sale” fell over 30% from February to March in the wake of the coronavirus’ entrance to the U.S., the World Health Organization declaring a global pandemic, and inaugural SIP orders. Along with consumer home-search behavior declining, the stock market plummeted and the Federal Reserve slashed mortgage rates in an attempt to stimulate investor activity.</p>
<p>Pre-pandemic consumer search volume for the Real Estate category in 2020 peaked in mid-February at 81 points before falling 46% to 44 points in mid-March, as the effects of COVID began to take a toll.</p>
<p>Understandably, the real estate industry was shaken. Those who witnessed the Great Recession of 2008 are likely plagued by similar encounters with plummeting stocks, threats of corporate bankruptcy and economic collapse. No one could be sure what the future held; whether the spring 2020 seller’s market was lost or if activity would cease entirely.</p>
<p>Despite an uncertain economic outlook, volatile stock market, and over <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf">38 million</a>Americans filing for unemployment benefits in the past nine weeks, the real estate market has already begun to recover.</p>
<p>Consumer search volume for “homes for sale” has now rebounded to <i>above</i> pre-COVID levels. As of May 17th, U.S. search activity in the Real Estate category was continuing to rise and search volume for “homes for sale” has hit 100 points, the highest monthly search volume it’s ever been.</p>
<div id="attachment_58853" style="width: 845px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-58853" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-58853 size-full" src="https://www.marketleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GT20200521-Consumer-Search-Volume-Index.png" alt="Google Trends Real Estate Search Volume COVID" width="835" height="503" /><p id="caption-attachment-58853" class="wp-caption-text">Data source: Google Trends</p></div>
<p>Despite a fast-recovering market, agent activity is not rebounding as quickly as consumer search volume and is still down 12-15% from pre-COVID levels.</p>
<p>There is <a href="/blog/real-estate-opportunities-to-seize-during-the-pandemic/">opportunity to be seized</a>.</p>
<p>We surveyed thousands of agents last month to understand what successes they were seeing, what they were doing to engage their markets. We learned a lot. The biggest takeaway from survey responses was this:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>The only agents who aren’t seeing any success right now are those doing nothing.</h3>
</blockquote>
<p><b>To recap, here’s what we learned</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">51% of agents are making care calls regularly and of those agents, 46% are generating new business.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">25% of agents are leveraging social media to stay in touch with their sphere and continue to market their listings; 35% of which are generating new business.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Only 5% of agents are investing in paid <a href="/products/real-estate-leads/">lead generation</a> services, but 75% of them are generating new business.</li>
</ul>
<p>Albeit cautiously, the real estate industry and markets across the country are rebounding. There are less active agents and those who are still active are less productive. The need for consumers to buy and sell real estate is not dependent on your willingness to show up. Transactions will close whether with you or your competition.</p>
<p>The real estate industry is resilient. Those who adapt and innovate to serve their clients in a shifting market are going to reap the rewards long far into a post-pandemic world.</p>
<p>We’ll continue to publish updated information, trends and resources as situations evolve. If you’ve got any successes, strategies or just positive stories to share as they relate to the global environment today – please share! We’d love to feature you and share your story with the industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We surveyed thousands of agents and were able to hear first-hand what’s working across the county and, not surprisingly, what isn’t.</p>
<p>Real estate is a resilient industry. As the responses show, most of you are continuing to invest in your businesses and, in turn, generating new business. In fact, the only agents who aren&#8217;t seeing any success with their efforts through SIP orders, social distancing recommendations, and overall sentiment in the current environment are those doing nothing.</p>
<p>Read that again.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>The only agents who aren’t seeing any success right now are those doing nothing.</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>Responses are categorized as successful if the respondent explicitly referenced new business generated as a direct result from outreach efforts.</p>
<p>The real estate industry is alive and well and you shared amazing insights and success stories!</p>
<h3><strong>Here&#8217;s what we learned</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h6>51% of agents are making care calls regularly and of those agents, 46% are generating new business.</h6>
</li>
<li>
<h6>25% of agents are leveraging social media to stay in touch with their sphere and continue to market their listings; 35% of which are generating new business.</h6>
</li>
<li>
<h6>Only 5% of agents are investing in paid lead generation services, but 75% of them are generating new business.</h6>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Ironically, the highest success rate was the least utilized resource for generating business; a glaring example of <a href="/blog/real-estate-opportunities-to-seize-during-the-pandemic/">opportunities</a> missed. We’ve said this before, and we will continue to say it until we are on the other side of this: this is not the time to sleep on your business. Doubling down on lead generation now will secure your seat at the table when the country rebounds.</p>
<h3>The bottom line: agents who are active and reaching out to their market right now are seeing success.</h3>
<p>Consumers are unsure if and how real estate is being conducted and whether it’s possible to keep moving. They are looking to you and, if not you, other agents in your market for both information and certainty. Show up, whether you have all the answers or not. Maintain your relationships, check in on your sphere and see what happens.</p>
<p>Donny Scott of <a href="https://greatscott.kw.com/great-scott">Great Scott Realty Group</a> in Burleson, TX has generated several new listings and pre-approved buyer leads from his outreach efforts. In addition to making welfare calls and emailing to build relationships, he is posting to his blog and social media with a positive spin.</p>
<p>The country is slowly starting to ease Stay-In-Place (SIP) orders, and, as consumer confidence begins to rebound, real estate agents are met with both an opportunity and an obligation to educate their market.</p>
<p>We recently hosted “<a href="/blog/shift-happens-thriving-in-a-changing-market/">SHIFT HAPPENS: Thriving in a Changing Market</a>” with special guest and powerhouse agent, Aubie Pouncey of KW Pacific NW. Aubie stresses, &#8220;The world is different. We are in a shift. It&#8217;s the <em>market of the moment.&#8221; </em></p>
<p>Aubie’s laurels rest on his ability to dive deep in data from his MLS and distill it in a way that educates his sphere enough to guide them through a decision-making process that is data-driven and puts people at ease.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-58773 alignright" src="https://www.marketleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ML-Quote-Aubie-Pouncey.png" alt="Aubie Pouncey Quote" width="1080" height="1080" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consumer search volume for “homes for sale” has completely rebounded to pre-COVID levels, but agent activity is still down 15% and not rebounding at the same rate as consumers.</p>
<p>We reiterate:<a href="/blog/real-estate-opportunities-to-seize-during-the-pandemic/"> opportunity is out there</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll continue to publish updated information, trends and resources as situations evolve. If you&#8217;ve got any successes, strategies or just positive stories to share as they relate to the global environment today &#8211; please share! We&#8217;d love to feature you and share your story with the industry.</p>
