										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After decades of coasting along relatively comfortably, the real estate industry is facing an onslaught of disruptors. It started with the listing portals – Zillow, Trulia and the others.</p>
<p>In the beginning, they were primarily lead generators (and lead sellers) and they stayed away from actual transactions.</p>
<p>Then, OpenDoor launched in 2014 and the industry began changing. This company and its imitators began “moving closer to the transaction … getting involved in more parts of” it, Michael DelPrete claims in an Inman Select <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2OmyguHNQE&amp;feature=youtu.be">video</a>.</p>
<p>With Instant Offers, he says, Zillow began “moving from search engine to service engine.”</p>
<p>Today, there are several others in the iBuyer space, all clamoring for the holy grail of real estate: listings.</p>
<h2><strong>What is an iBuyer?</strong></h2>
<p>iBuyers are quite similar to the cash-heavy real estate investors who make rock bottom offers on homes, fix them up and flip them. Apparently, iBuyers bristle at being called “flippers,” but that’s pretty much what they are.</p>
<p>But, that’s an opinion and, like all opinions, there’s an opposing side. Some, like the brilliant Notorious R.O.B, beg to differ.</p>
<p>“iBuyer is Not Real Estate Investing; Real Estate Investing is Not iBuyer,” he <a href="https://notorious-rob.com/2018/11/the-case-for-ibuyer-becoming-the-default/">says</a> and for proof of his point he quotes (wait for it) <em>Spencer Rascoff</em>.</p>
<p>Rascoff’s argument, by the way, is that “Flipping requires distressed homes and distressed sellers, people that are selling their home under duress, and it only applies to a very small segment of the market.”</p>
<p>Those who utilize the services of iBuyer companies, on the other hand, favor “speed, certainty, ease, convenience,” Rascoff continues.</p>
<p>Who is he trying to kid?</p>
<p>“The motivated Seller who wants to sell fast, is willing to sell low, and does not want to work with an agent is the one the Investor wants,” says an investor at BiggerPockets.com. She describes the very <em>same</em> consumer that iBuyers target.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>So, buying homes at less-than-market value, fixing them up and then reselling them is called “flipping,” but <em>not</em> when Zillow does it.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>In fact, all of the companies in this space stress (repeatedly) that their home sale process is “convenient and hassle-free.”</p>
<p>The bottom line for the consumer, however, is that iBuyers use automated value models (AVMs) and we all know how unreliable those are. Then, there are plenty of horror stories from home sellers about the pitiably small offers they’ve received.</p>
<p>“An agent in Atlanta requested offers on his own newly renovated home with OpenDoor, Knock, and OfferPad to see how the process worked,” explains an unnamed writer at MetroBrokers.com.</p>
<blockquote><p>“His property, which was appraised at $495,000, received [iBuyer] offers from $265,000 on the low end to $373,000 on the high end.”</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s easy to read that and assume that iBuyers are going nowhere, fast. And, nationally, they only capture 0.2 percent of the market (2018, all U.S. iBuyers), according to DelPrete.</p>
<p>But he also goes on to remind us that all real estate is local: “In November of 2018, in Phoenix, the market share of all iBuyers was 5 percent.”</p>
<p>Zillow’s Instant Offer generated 20,000 Phoenix listing leads in its first four months in the market. That’s 20,000 homeowners in one city who actually clicked through and requested an offer from Zillow, DelPrete explains.</p>
<p>Impressive, right?</p>
<h2><strong>Is there any good news for agents in all this?</strong></h2>
<p>Let’s get back to those 20,000 leads that Zillow generated. DelPrete says that the company purchased only one percent of the homes.</p>
<p>Unlike agents, however, Zillow doesn’t <a href="/blog/the-biggest-mistakes-agents-make-with-leads/">throw away leads</a> that don’t or can’t immediately transact. In fact, they’ll be selling 99 percent of those 20,000 leads to you guys.</p>
<p>These are leads who were motivated enough to ask Zillow for an evaluation of their home’s value for possible participation in the Instant Offer program. So, motivation is the bonus.</p>
<p>The downside to these leads is that they’ll most likely haggle over your commission and they may be unrealistic about their price (thus why Zillow didn’t work with them).</p>
<h2><strong>How can agents compete?</strong></h2>
<p>This is one of those question that stumps the industry. Many agents feel that they don’t need to compete.</p>
<p>“Because the one thing startups can’t disrupt is the real estate agent,” according to Henry Grabar, staff writer for <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2018/06/redfin-zillow-and-opendoor-cant-disrupt-real-estate-agents-and-may-not-want-to.html">Slate.com’s Moneybox</a></p>
<p>Perhaps making just a few changes, if performed en masse, is the answer.</p>
<p>Presenting your services in a more positive light will go a long way in combatting the lure of convenience and the “hassle-free” process that iBuyers promote.</p>
<p>Sure, selling a home is somewhat of a hassle. Remind potential listing clients that with the right agent, it can be a smooth process and bring in top dollar for the home.</p>
<h2><strong>In short, watch your words.</strong></h2>
<p>I recently read a real estate blog post that began with an entire paragraph about just how much of a hassle selling a home can be.</p>
<p>“Selling your house can be one of the most stressful events of your life,” it begins. Then, there’s the attempt to scare the you-know-what out of the seller by reminding him or her that the home will be open to “total strangers.”</p>
<p>The negativity doesn’t stop there, though. The third sentence reminds the seller that “you’re facing the daunting task of moving in the (hopefully near) future, and you’re worried about the finances of selling your home.”</p>
<p>Not content with reminding the reader that moving is a “daunting task,” the writer also felt the need to slip in a hint that the home <em>may</em> not sell in the near future.</p>
<p>Finishing up this completely stupefying paragraph is the reminder that “uncertainty” underlies the entire home sale process: “will you find a good buyer in time, will you get a fair value for your home, and will the sale of your home go smoothly?”</p>
<p>I don’t know about you, but after reading this, I’d sincerely consider going with an iBuyer.</p>
<p>I get it. If you explain just how complex the home sale process is, sellers will be less likely to go FSBO.</p>
<p>But FSBO isn’t their only option in 2019. While some agents are sounding like Debbie Downer in their marketing copy, the iBuyer folks are all sunshine and unicorns in explaining how easy-breezy their process is.</p>
<h2><strong>Use iBuyers&#8217; ignorance to your benefit.</strong></h2>
<p>You, as a boot on the ground, have the experience of working directly with real estate consumers. Perhaps decades of this experience. You know what they want and what they don’t want.</p>
<p>Those at the top of the iBuyer chain do not. In fact, at least in Zillow’s case, they’ve vastly misunderstood the typical home seller. Jeremy Wacksman, Zillow’s chief marketing officer, claims to know exactly what home sellers want.</p>
<p>“What they care about is pushing the button and making magic happen,” he claims.</p>
<p>“Magic, in this case, means selling your house in a matter of days, even at a small discount,” Grabar adds.</p>
<p>Can anyone be more out of touch with the average real estate consumer? Yes, home sellers would LOVE to have a “magic button.” Their idea of “magic,” however, is selling the house in a matter of days FOR FULL MARKET VALUE.</p>
<p><strong>How many sellers have you dealt with who were willing to take one cent less than what their home is worth just to have it sell quicker? </strong></p>
<p>Let’s agree that from here forward, your marketing to home sellers will be more positive about the process. Remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your method of determining their home’s value is far superior to an AVM.</li>
<li>Even Spencer Rascoff’s home value wasn’t nailed by Zillow’s AVM.</li>
<li>Since iBuyer fees are higher than real estate commissions (at least for now), home sellers working with an agent will not only make more money from the sale but have professional representation as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally? We don’t think you have anything to worry about.</p>
<p>The lazy agent, the complacent agent and the one who is in it just for the money?</p>
<p>They should worry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OK, who is the wise guy (or gal) who first suggested that folding your arms for your real estate business card photo is cool?</p>
<p>We don’t know for sure, but it seems like nine out of 10 agents have chosen this pose. It’s a particularly curious practice in a business where practitioners say they crave a way to set themselves apart from others.</p>
<p>Same pose.</p>
<p>Same smile.</p>
<p>“It’s contagious. One of them gets an idea and it spreads through the body like a flu,” House of Cards’ President Frank Underwood claims.</p>
<p>If that’s true, members of the Senate and real estate agents have a lot in common.</p>
<p>With real estate agent business cards, you have just seven square inches to convey your message. If half of that is taken up by your photo, and your photo screams “Nothing unique to look at here!” you’re doing yourself no favors.</p>
<p>So, how can you use that valuable space for all it’s worth? We went to the experts to find out.</p>
<h2>To headshot or not?</h2>
<p>The arguments for using a photo on a real estate business card equal the number against. Southern California broker/agent Mellissa Zavala is in both camps, feeling that some situations call for a card with her photo.</p>
<p>She solves the dilemma by carrying two different cards, one with and one without her headshot. The former is used in “situations where I want to people to remember more than just my name,” Zavala claims.</p>
<p>Other agents feel that the photo is important, but not so much that it should take up the more valuable “real estate” of the tiny business card. These agents put their photo on the back.</p>
<p>Eric Bryn, attorney, adjunct professor at Loyola University, and Chicago broker points out that professionals in other industries don’t plaster their business cards with their photos (they don’t offer their clients gifts at the end of a business deal either, but that’s fodder for another blog post).</p>
<p>“In the space where the headshot goes, why not add a core value statement?” he asks. He goes on to explain an even bigger reason he’s against the ubiquitous agent photo on business cards. “A few years back we did a really cool test,” he begins. “We printed 2000 post cards for a client. Same exact message on both. One had a picture of an agent on the card, the other did not.</p>
<p>Both had a very clear and defined call to action &#8211; a phone number. Each had a different number so we could get accurate results,” Bryn explains.<br />
He and his team sent 1,000 of each card to area addresses. The results are pretty astounding.</p>
<p>They got zero response from the 1,000 cards sent out that contained the agent’s photo and nearly 200 responses from the 1,000 cards that lacked a photo.<br />
Bryn goes on to explain that they’ve done similar tests on other types of agent marketing, such as webpages, whole sites, business cards and more. In every test, he claims, the marketing piece without the agent’s photo out-performs the one with the photo.</p>
<p>They have never found, “a situation where an image of an agent increases conversation. What we find is, it completely obliterates it.”<br />
Agents and brokers who do recommend using a photo on a business card stress that the photo should be recent and professionally shot.</p>
<h2>Agent – Heal Thyself</h2>
<p>When counselling your listing clients on how to ensure their homes make a brilliant first impression, you suggest that they clean and declutter, right? Then, as you walk out the door, you remind them to call you if they need anything, handing them a business card that is full of clutter.<br />
From the string of letters behind your name to a fax number, a headshot and every conceivable way to contact you, the card looks a bit like an ugly home page on a website.</p>
<p>Cleaning up the clutter on your business card may help yours avoid being among the 88 percent that are tossed into the trash within the first week of receiving them.</p>
<h4>Give your logo the space you devoted to your headshot and then include:</h4>
<h5 style="padding-left: 30px;">• Name (personal and brokerage)<br />
• Email address<br />
• Phone number<br />
• Website URL<br />
• URL of the social media site you’re most active on</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Pay attention to aesthetics</h2>
<p>Designing a business card is a lot like designing a website; some of the same aesthetics apply.</p>
<h5 style="padding-left: 30px;">• Font choice<br />
• Color<br />
• Lots of white space</h5>
<p>In fact, experts recommend that you use your website branding concept on your business card.</p>
<p>Card stock is something you’ll need to think about as well. “When I receive a business card, I create an opinion about the company as soon as the card touches my hand. Is it thin and flimsy? Is it thick cardstock?” Chris Ake of Grand Apps asks the Forbes Agency Council.</p>
<p>“Cheap business cards get printed on: 100 lb. gloss cover,” suggests Andrew Shu, with MGX Copy, a San Diego print company. He goes on to say, however, that a card printed on this stock “feels perfectly fine, and it doesn’t feel cheap.”</p>
<p>Fourteen and 15-point card stocks, on the other hand, “feel very corporate and professional.”</p>
<h2>Has technology killed the business card?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>All of the above depends, of course, on which camp you’re in when it comes to business cards:</h4>
<h5 style="padding-left: 30px;">• They are a must for real estate agents – old-school has merit<br />
• This is the 21st century – business cards are outdated</h5>
<p>Personally, I can’t recall the last time I received a business card. Even the agent who helped me buy my home two years ago didn’t proffer one.</p>
<p>“Business cards still hold a purpose, which is quickly exchanging information at events, conferences and other networking opportunities,” Leila Lewis of Be Inspired PR tells Forbes.com.</p>
<p>Mark Sims, founder of Foundation, a design and branding company, claims that it’s the smartphone that has killed the business card,“ . . . we can swap and store contact information with one another with a simple tap of the phone,” he says, which does away with the need for a business card. This “tap,” however, doesn’t “carry forward your brand identity,” he continues.</p>
<p>If this is important to you, keep using business cards. And, unless you hope to mimic the Black Astrum card ($1,500 per card and, yes, those are real diamonds), business cards remain an economical way to broadcast your brand.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/real-estate-business-card-tips-for-agents/">Real Estate Business Card Tips for Agents</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Enhance Curb Appeal to Reel Buyers in</h1>
<p>When you pull up to the curb in front of a listing only to have your buyers ask you to drive on, you’ll understand, instantly, the power of curb appeal (or lack thereof).</p>
<p>Attractiveness sells, whether it’s a car, a pair of shoes or a house. In fact, studies shows that, although homebuyers are not necessarily drawn to more attractive real estate agents, “the more attractive the agent, the more the buyer is willing to pay.”*</p>
<p>It only makes sense then that the more attractive a house is, the more the buyer is willing pay.</p>
<p>Yet even a cursory stroll through the MLS shows evidence of clueless homeowners who lack the common sense (or the funds) to present their homes attractively.</p>
<p><strong>In all fairness, though, is it the homeowner who lacks the common sense or the listing agent?</strong></p>
<p>Gone are the days when your duties with listing clients consisted of sticking the sign in the yard, hooking the lockbox to the doorknob and entering the home’s vitals in the MLS.</p>
<p>No, the home’s curb appeal isn’t your job. But, counselling your client about its importance and offering valuable tips most certainly is.</p>
<h2>It’s time to have “the talk”</h2>
<p>It’s not easy to let someone know that their home stinks or that, perhaps, they aren’t the best housekeeper on the planet. Potential buyers will most certainly let them know by either not touring the home or with their lack of offers.</p>
<p>Since both of you want the most money for the home that the market will bear, it falls on you to have that uncomfortable talk with your listing clients</p>
<p>Before speaking with them, go through the MLS and save examples of sold homes lacking curb appeal and a similar home whose owner’s took the time to spiff up the exteriors.</p>
<p>The price differential should sell them on the idea of paying attention to the home’s exterior. If not, use anecdotes from your own real estate practice, such as the one at the beginning of this post.</p>
<p>Then, offer suggestions on what they can do to make the home more appealing to potential buyers.</p>
<p>One agent we know has a dedicated file on her computer of suggestion pages for her listing clients (how to choose a paint color, what to consider when painting a home for sale, etc.). She then emails the pertinent ones to her listing clients.</p>
<h2>Speaking of paint</h2>
<p>Most experts agree that homeowners should start their curb appeal project with the house itself and then work their way out to the curb.</p>
<p>If it’s a new coat of paint that will help the home stand out, don’t hesitate to suggest it. And, since color is so important, offer your client some tips, such as:</p>
<h3>Which colors will the HOA allow?</h3>
<p>Remind homeowners who live in a managed community that their HOA may have color restrictions, and to consult the CC&amp;Rs to find out before settling on a color scheme.</p>
<h3>Which colors help homes sell?</h3>
<p>A Minnesota builder posted a photo of one of his homes at Houzz.com and received thousands of requests for the color. You’ll find it at <a href="https://www.bobvila.com/slideshow/12-exterior-paint-colors-to-help-sell-your-house-47419#gray-house">BobVila.com</a>.</p>
<p>Zillow offers up the results of its <a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/paint-colors-help-sell-20240/">2018 Zillow Paint Colors Analysis</a>. Find out which exterior colors are most likely to add value to the home.</p>
<h3>Consider the surroundings</h3>
<p>Ensure that the color they choose harmonizes with the unpainted exterior features, such as the roof.</p>
<p>Find additional color-choosing tips to pass on to your clients at <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/choosing-exterior-paint-colors-176052">ThoughtCo.com</a>.</p>
<h2>The front door</h2>
<p>Since potential buyers will hopefully get up close to the front door, counsel your clients to either get a new one or make the current one pop.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2018/">2018 Cost vs. Value</a> report from Remodeling Magazine ranks a new front door (made of steel) as the project with the third highest ROI.</p>
<p>If all it needs is a coat of paint, see Zillow’s paint color study, mentioned previously, to learn how much value a black front door adds to the home.</p>
<h2>Garage door</h2>
<p>If the garage is situated near the front of the house, it comprises a large amount of the view potential buyers will see when they drive up to the home.</p>
<p>Suggest that the homeowners paint or replace it. A new “upscale” garage door, by the way, is the project with the highest ROI, according to the <a href="http://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/garage-door-replacement-upscale?y=2018">Remodeling Magazine</a> study.</p>
<h2>Landscaping</h2>
<p>As any buyers’ agent knows, little things do get noticed. Share this information with your listing clients and urge them to spiff up the landscaping.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pull weeds</li>
<li>Remove branches and other debris from the front yard</li>
<li>Consider adding new edging to the beds</li>
<li>Spread fresh mulch in the beds</li>
<li>Green up the lawn and keep it mowed</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional small changes to suggest include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Replacing the builder’s standard front porch light with something more attractive</li>
<li>Buy a new welcome mat</li>
<li>Install big, bold house numbers</li>
<li>Paint or replace the mailbox</li>
</ul>
<p>While the conversation about the home’s condition is uncomfortable, it’s necessary if your clients hope to get the most money possible for the home. Consider writing up your advice with a checklist to make it easier for everyone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now’s a great time to call your prospects and tell them to lock in a good mortgage rate.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a nice run of rock bottom interest rates, but mortgage rates are on the rise once again. Rates have gone up substantially just since the first of the year, buoyed by a strong economy and the return of inflationary pressures.</p>
<p>As of March 1<sup>st</sup>, mortgage rates have risen for eight consecutive weeks, rising to an average of 4.57 percent, for a fixed 30-year conventional mortgage.</p>
<p>We’re already seeing higher mortgage rates impact home sales, though prices continued to rise, 2.5 percent in January – the last full month for which data is currently available. But pending home sales slipped to a three-year low that month.  According to National Association of Realtors data, the number of new listings nationwide also fell a whopping 9.5 percent compared to January of last year.</p>
<p>The good news for agents is this:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-jobless-claims-plunge-to-49-year-low-of-210000-2018-03-01">The unemployment rate is the best it’s been in nearly five decades.</a></p>
<p>So if you can coach clients to keep credit utilization down, and pay their bills on time, they should be able to get a mortgage.</p>
<p>Either way, now’s a great time to reach out to your prospects and fence sitters, and spread the word:</p>
<p>Interest rates are going up and listings are going down faster than pending sales.</p>
<h3>U.S. 30-Year Fixed Mortgage Rates, 1 January to 28 February, 2018</h3>
<div id="attachment_55269" style="width: 1942px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55269" class="wp-image-55269 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/20180301-MORTGAGE.png" alt="2018 FRED 30-year fixed mortgage rate average in the united states" width="1932" height="928" /><p id="caption-attachment-55269" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Source: Freddie Mac </em></p></div>
<p>Historically, increasing rates have typically led to falling home sales: About 35 thousand fewer sales nationwide for every 10 basis points, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p>Why are rates moving higher? In the mortgage world, it’s because of continued growth forecasts. Markets are still predicting continued economic growth. Which is great for jobs, and great for future homeowners. It also means that there’s a danger of rising inflation, as well.</p>
<p>Lenders have to compensate themselves for that risk: They can’t lend at 3 percent if inflation is at 4 percent. That equates to a 1 percent loss of wealth, every year. They have to increase interest rates to account for it.</p>
<p>Call, email, text or write your prospects who’ve been on the fence for a while.</p>
<p>Here’s the message:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interest rates are going up, and fast.</li>
<li>People are already starting to put fewer houses on the market.</li>
<li>The job situation looks good. Future employment prospects are excellent</li>
<li>As long as the economy improves, home prices will keep going up.</li>
<li>The cost of real estate and the cost of money are both increasing fast.</li>
<li>The time to lock in a rate and buy that dream home is</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, mortgage rates were at rock bottom just a short time ago – But they’re going up and they’re going to continue to rise, with <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-mortgage-rates-20180301-story.html">no end in sight</a>.</p>
<p>Send an email or newsletter with the graph showing increasing interest rates. And then follow up on the phone. Ask outright – “did you get the piece I sent?”</p>
<p>Whatever they answer, you’re set up for the conversation – why they need to lock in a good mortgage rate <em>now. </em></p>
<h1>The Conversation</h1>
<p>Locking in makes sense for three reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It reduces your cost of ownership</strong>: Every dollar you <em>don’t</em> have to pay in interest is a dollar you can turn into home equity or savings. The sooner you lock in, the more home equity or the more savings you can build, faster.There’s no reason to pay 4.9 percent when you can get the same mortgage at 4.43 percent and save tens of thousands of dollars.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>It reduces uncertainty. </strong>Mortgage rates haven’t just been increasing – they’ve been getting more volatile. It’s nerve wracking for everybody once your offer’s been accepted and you’re lining up financing, but you have no idea what the final mortgage payment is going to be.<strong> </strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>You can buy a better house.</strong> The lower your mortgage rate, the more home you can qualify for. This expands your set of options: You can raise your family in a better school district. You can have a back yard. Each kid can have their own bedroom. That extra buying power that you can qualify for at a lower rate isn’t just money – it comes with real world lifestyle, education and safety advantages.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Your follow-up at this point depends on the prospect’s response. Are they ready to go? Then get them in touch with a lender and start the process. Follow up and make sure the appointment is made.</p>
<p>Are they hesitating? Find out why. They might be worried about their credit or the <a href="/blog/mortgage-loan-approval/">mortgage approval process</a>. In that case, you can add a lot of value, and you have a good chance of being their agent in an eventual home purchase – just not right now. How? Coach them on how to <a href="/blog/9-ways-to-help-clients-improve-credit-scores/">improve their credit score</a> so they can get that mortgage.</p>
<p>Whatever they tell you, you’re still a winner. By reaching out, you’re ensuring top-of-mind awareness. You’re showing the prospect that you remember them, and you’re looking out for their best interest.</p>
<p>Any productive conversation works for you, and gets you that much closer to your next sale.</p>
<p>Don’t be call shy. Pick up the phone and guide people through the process and into their dream home.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/mortgage-rates-are-climbing-call-your-prospects-now-heres-how/">Mortgage Rates Are Climbing – Call Your Prospects Now.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Make 2018 the Year You Leverage Social Proof</h2>
<p>You have tons of experience. You offer stellar customer service. You’ve developed a killer website. Even your branding is cool.</p>
<p>Guess what? It’s not enough.</p>
<p>Not in 2018.</p>
<p>Like this year’s, next year’s clients want proof before they agree to work with you. And, they want proof from people who have actually used your real estate services.</p>
<p>Make 2018 the year you focus on gathering the social proof you need to help potential clients judge your credibility as a real estate authority, get to know you, and build trust.</p>
<h3>What is social proof?</h3>
<p>A herd of sheep will instinctually stick together, for protection. Where one goes, the others follow – whether it’s back to the farm for supper or to the slaughterhouse, the instinct rules.</p>
<p>We humans have similar inclinations. A famous 1969 study (Milgram et al.) on “the drawing power of crowds of different sizes” found that 4 percent of folks passing by would stop to join one person looking up at a skyscraper.</p>
<p>When there were 15 people looking skyward, the number of passersby who stopped to join them increased to 40 percent. Additionally, 86 percent of passersby, even if they didn’t stop, would look up to see what everyone was looking at.</p>
<p>“We often imitate others’ actions when making choices with limited information about what’s best,” claims David Stipp at <a href="https://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1996/10/14/217822/index.htm">Fortune.com</a>. “It’s almost a law of nature,” he concludes.</p>
<p>It’s herd behavior and, although it can have negative consequences, it can also be a boon to your marketing efforts.</p>
<h3>Why does it matter?</h3>
<p>A majority of the 2,000 Americans surveyed by Mintel, a market analysis agency, say that online reviews dictate which products they buy and services they use.</p>
<p>It’s only natural, right? We all want to ensure that we’re purchasing the “best” product or hiring the “best” hair stylist.</p>
<p>“In a never-ending quest to buy the ‘best,’ consumers are looking to others’ opinions and experiences via online review sites to validate their choices – and to avoid feeling buyers’ remorse,” Mintel’s Fiona O’Donnell claims in their American Lifestyles 2015 study.</p>
<p>Although consumers of all ages perform this gut check, it is far more common in millennials than in older and younger generations. And, since that particular demographic represents the real estate consumers of tomorrow, social proof becomes even more important.</p>
<h3>How is your online reputation?</h3>
<p>The first thing to consider when starting a social proof campaign is to determine where you stand right now. Will you be starting with a blank slate or multitudes of reviews scattered across the internet?</p>
<p>How many negative reviews will you need to combat? Cleaning up your online reputation takes time and effort unless you have the big bucks required to hire a company to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2013/03/14/6-steps-to-managing-your-online-reputation/?sh=5a12293b7767">manage your online reputation.</a></p>
<p>And, lest you think image polishing isn’t important, consider this: 75 percent of HR professionals and recruiters say that they have “personnel to research applicants online,” according to a Cross-Tab <a href="https://www.job-hunt.org/guides/DPD_Online-Reputation-Research_overview.pdf">study</a>.</p>
<p>Even more frightening (at least for job hunters) is that 70 percent of these hiring pros claim that they have rejected candidates based on what they found out about them online.</p>
<p>Sure, you’re not hoping to be recruited, but if HR professionals seek out social proof for job applicants, it’s a safe bet that real estate consumers do the same when researching real estate agents.</p>
<h3>Types of social proof to consider for your real estate business:</h3>
<p><strong>Review sites</strong> &#8212; It’s not enough to have online reviews and testimonials on one site. Gut checkers view two to three different review sites before they make a decision, according to BrightLocal’s Consumer Review Survey 2016.</p>
<p>When researching real estate agents, these review sites typically include Yelp, Zillow and Google. Since Google search results for “real estate agents in” typically come with Google reviews, it’s a good idea to concentrate on the search giant first. Setting up a <a href="https://www.google.com/business/?gmbsrc=us-en-ha-se-z-gmb-s-z-h~bk&amp;ppsrc=GMBS0&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI8v7G8IWF1wIVCmh-Ch2LrQtWEAAYASAAEgIDkvD_BwE&amp;dclid=CImD6PeFhdcCFRB2Ygodb-APEA">Google Business Page</a> is a great place to start.</p>
<p><strong>Testimonials</strong> – BrightLocal’s survey found that the “authenticity of reviews is the most important factor for consumers to trust the reviews they read.” They want to know that these testimonials are coming from actual people – clients who have used you to represent them when buying or selling a home.</p>
<p>Bring your testimonials to life by including a photo of your clients (with their permission, of course) <a href="/blog/2018-real-estate-trends-content-marketing-reigns-king/">above</a> their glowing recommendation.</p>
<p><strong>Case studies</strong> – These are another way to give life to your testimonials. They are basically stories that illustrate a client’s problem and how you, as an agent, solved it. Not only are they effective on websites, but because of they are typically photo-intensive, they work well when included with other marketing materials, such as listing presentations and newsletters.</p>
<p><strong>Take it offline, too. </strong></p>
<p>Testimonials can be used in all of your marketing materials as long as you don’t overdo it. Choose one or two of your favorites and use them in your newsletters.</p>
<p>Use them in listing presentations, on door hangers, direct mail pieces – all of your offline marketing materials can and should contain at least one testimonial.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/2018-real-estate-trends-social-proof/">2018 Real Estate Trends: Social Proof</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As real estate technology advances, knowing where to invest your tech dollars can seem like an elusive quest. We&#8217;ve researched emerging trends and just how important they will be to real estate professionals approaching the new year.</p>
<p><strong>Manage and nurture your contacts: Get a CRM that optimizes both.</strong></p>
<p>If your goal is to maximize your ability to manage, nurture, and track your relationships, it’s important to invest in a CRM that facilitates engaging with your contacts in addition to simply managing them. A robust CRM will house the features you need that are specific to real estate and your personal business. This includes alerts as new leads come into your pipeline, whether through your website or other lead sources, your CRM system should automatically integrate contacts from third-party sources.</p>
<p>An integrated CRM must also come equipped with marketing solutions. Important features to look for include:</p>
<ul>
<li>IDX website and integration</li>
<li>Newsletter automation</li>
<li>Customized email templates</li>
<li>Email blasts and drip email campaigns</li>
<li>MLS listing alerts</li>
<li>Professionally designed and customizable templates for flyers, postcards, and multi-step campaigns.</li>
</ul>
<p>If there’s one piece of technology all real estate professionals should have and maximize, it’s a robust CRM. In an industry built exclusively on relationships, having a system that doesn’t just allow you to manage relationships, but helps you nurture and engage them is key.</p>
<p><strong>Lose the hard files and get on the cloud</strong>.</p>
<p>If you’re still using a Rolodex, chances are your entire record-keeping ecosystem is a bit out-dated. Aside from running the risk of being disorganized and not being able to manage your business on the go, you risk losing documents with someone’s sensitive and confidential information – which could result in a lawsuit.</p>
<p>Cloud services can be a number of things, but typically consist of services, data, and software, available on demand, so long as the person trying to access has an internet connection. Cloud services are quickly becoming the new standard for digital products. Common cloud services include hosting services, storage, and software. For instance, <a href="http://www.marketleader.com/products/professional-for-agents/">Market Leader products</a>, including websites, CRM system, and marketing center are all software services available anywhere, including mobile devices, via the internet &#8211; i.e., on the cloud.</p>
<p><strong>Get Virtual.</strong></p>
<p>To cater to all generational buyers, sellers, and renters, it’s increasingly important to keep up with technology capable of disrupting the real estate space. Conventional listings, tours, and open houses are trending digital to cater to millennials and Gen Z buyers. Younger, tech-savvy generations are conducting up to 90 percent of their research online before you’ve even made contact with them. Having impressive visuals, like <a href="https://www.inman.com/2016/04/12/why-do-agents-need-virtual-tours/">virtual tours</a>, on your website is becoming an expectation, rather than attractive luxury.</p>
<p>Sellers listing their homes have rising expectations as well. They want their properties marketed alongside the best of the best. Virtual tours have become on way to engage prospects viewing your listings and website. Thankfully, as technology advances and becomes more accessible, prices come to be more affordable (averaging about $300.00 for a 3,000 square foot home).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hgtv.com/design/real-estate/how-to-stage-your-home-with-the-click-of-a-mouse">Virtual staging</a> is another increasingly popular technology to lure potential buyers by turning empty spaces into furnished, perfectly staged rooms that better helps buyers visualize themselves in a space. Change wall colors, flooring, even upgrade finishes to help shoppers visualize a home’s potential. Virtual staging tends to cost much less than traditional staging, too, averaging between two and four hundred dollars. Be sure to disclose any properties that have been staged virtually, however, to avoid any unmet expectations in person.</p>
<p><strong>Take advantage of analytics.</strong><br />
While analytics are less of a financial investment, they’re vital to tracking and managing your successes. <a href="https://analytics.google.com/">Google analytics</a> are free and offer valuable insights on every page of your website, the ability to drill down your pages and content to identify what performs best, and track your digital advertisements.</p>
<p>If you have business pages on Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter, each platform offers in-house analytics and insights to track your pages’ activities and performance. LinkedIn offers post analytics for individual pages, and in-depth insights for followers, visitors, and updates. Many analytics resources are available and free to use, so be sure to explore the tools you’re already using and the insights they offer. Remember: if it can’t be measured, it can’t be improved or repeated.</p>
<p>One big trend cultivating as we approach 2018 is predictive analytics. Predictive analytics can easily sound out of reach, but it’s likely you’re already using tools that feature this technology. In short, predictive analytics help you project future pricing on properties and neighborhoods by using historical data to forecast trends. This information most often comes in the form of CMAs. As this technology advances with the advent of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2017/03/14/the-complete-beginners-guide-to-big-data-in-2017/#2c09f4b17365">Big Data</a> and digital transformations, predictive analytics will be showing up in bigger ways as we approach the new year.</p>
<p>2018 is right around the corner and there are technologies worth investing in to give you a competitive edge. From managing your contacts and streamlining your marketing efforts to impressive listing visuals and tracking important metrics online, technology offers tools that will help you manage, grow, measure, and improve your business &#8211; all with a very transparent ROI.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-53577 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/content-definition.png" alt="content marketing definition" width="556" height="138" /></p>
<p>Content has long been an integral part of any successful marketing strategy. However necessary, there are likely hundreds of thousands of results that populate when searching any given real estate keyword.  This is where insight comes in: if you want your content to stand out on the crowded world wide web, you&#8217;ve got to offer your readers valuable insight.</p>
<h4>Every piece of content you produce, share, or curate should pass the following insight test:</h4>
<p>Does this content offer insights that my readers will find valuable?<br />
Does this content offer an original perspective?<br />
Does this content entertain, inspire, or educate my audience?<br />
Does this content position me as an expert on this topic?</p>
<p>If you can&#8217;t answer, &#8220;Yes,&#8221; to the previous questions about a particular piece of content, you might want to think twice about sharing it.</p>
<h2><strong>Content will still be king.</strong></h2>
<p>While content as a whole will always be king, if it doesn&#8217;t offer valuable insight, it&#8217;s not going to go to work for you. Always adhere to the 80/20 rule: 80 percent of your content should entertain, inspire, or educate your readers and no more than 20 percent should promote your brand or services.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-53573 size-full alignright" style="color: #666666; font-size: 14px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2-2.png" alt="content marketing quote" width="260" height="143" />&#8220;I&#8217;ve realized that no marketing is possible without content,” according to Rebecca Lieb, author of Content &#8211; The Atomic Particle of Marketing: The Definitive Guide to Content Marketing Strategy.</p>
<p>And, in real estate, the following content marketing ideas that offer valuable insights, should top your list.</p>
<h3><strong>You say &#8216;tomato,&#8217; we say &#8216;testimonial&#8217;</strong></h3>
<p>In the tech universe, a <a href="/blog/how-to-use-client-testimonials/">client testimonial</a> is known as UGC, or “user-generated content,” and in 2018 it will become more important than ever.</p>
<p>Global Consumer Report, a study conducted by software company Olapic, claims that &#8220;76 percent of consumers believe the content that average people share is more honest than advertising from brands.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let’s look at ways to make sure that 2018 is the year you do something productive with your reviews and testimonials.</p>
<h4>Make your testimonials work even harder for you by including the clients’ photos.</h4>
<p>The Olapic study also found that over half of respondents are more likely to buy a product (or use a service) if they see images of the consumer who is reviewing it.</p>
<p>If you’re chasing millennial homebuyers, including a photo is even more important, as they are the demographic who rely most heavily on social proof – featuring real people – to gain trust about a brand.</p>
<h4>Position your clients’ photos above their testimonials for higher conversion rates.</h4>
<p>And, if the only place potential clients will see these trust-promoting words of delight from former clients is on your website, you have work to do.</p>
<p>Use photo-accompanied testimonials in your newsletters and other email marketing. In fact, consider including a quick case study of a former client in each email of your drip campaign.</p>
<h4><strong>Case studies are testimonials on steroids.</strong></h4>
<p>While video testimonials can be powerful, they’re also labor intensive to create and, if done right, they’re expensive. You can derive the same impact through the use of case studies.</p>
<p>In them, you tell your clients’ stories – where they were before they decided to use your services, what challenges they faced that you helped them overcome and a description of the happy outcome. All this story-telling is surrounded by gorgeous photos.</p>
<p>Use the case studies in your listing presentations, on your website, newsletters, brochures and other marketing materials. Push them out on social media occasionally to drive eyes back to your site.</p>
<h3><strong>Neighborhood pages help boost local SEO.</strong></h3>
<p>You already know that in-depth neighborhood descriptions on your website help demonstrate your local expertise. But they can do so much more – most specifically, help you rank better in local organic searches.</p>
<p>Sure, your competition may be using them as well, but if the pages aren’t optimized properly, they may as well just delete them from their site. So, make 2018 the year you go head-to-head with your competition and outrank them in local searches.</p>
<p>A lively and in-depth text description of each neighborhood you serve, is a good start. But adding images of the area’s most popular spots will not only help make the pages more user-friendly, but, if they’re <a href="https://yoast.com/image-seo/">optimized for SEO</a>, they can help boost the amount of traffic your website receives, too.</p>
<p>Neighborhood pages present many agents with the perfect vehicle to compete with Google’s page one hogs. Yes, it’s challenging for those in the larger markets, but agents in small to medium markets are finding great success.</p>
<h4>Don’t forget to link back from your neighborhood-specific blog posts to your neighborhood pages to boost SEO.</h4>
<p>Once the content and photos are in place, go back over the descriptions and drop in some relevant local keywords (making them sound natural, of course).</p>
<h3><strong>Blogging 2018-style</strong></h3>
<p>In case you haven’t figured it out yet, 2018 will be the year of authenticity when it comes to content. Consumers want to be informed or entertained through content – not outright sold to.</p>
<p>This will be a tough one for many in the real estate industry; those who fill their Facebook feeds and blogs with new or sold listings will perish.</p>
<p>Your savvy competition understands this and, going into 2018 you’ll see them ramping up their blogging frequency and quality.</p>
<p>Your blog, if done right, helps build brand awareness and client loyalty, exhibits your expertise, increases website traffic and boosts lead generation.</p>
<p>In fact, according to <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blogging-frequency-benchmarks">Hubspot</a>, if you blog consistently, your site will receive 55 percent more visitors and, if you blog frequently (16 or more posts a month), you’ll receive 4.5 times more leads than agents in your area who don’t blog.</p>
<p>But, if you don’t post the information real estate consumers are craving, you may as well delete the blog from your site. They don’t care about your sold listings, so avoid using them as blog fodder.<img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-53571 alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Capture-2-1.png" alt="content marketing quote" width="250" height="178" /></p>
<p>“Most brands still treat their content marketing like advertising. For content marketing to truly work, it must be differentiated and consistently produced over a long time.” &#8211; <a href="https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2017/09/content-marketing-trends-2018/">Joe Pulizzi</a></p>
<p>The key is quality, authentic content, laid out in an SEO package. And, because blogging will be so important in 2018, if you can’t write (or don’t have the time) and you don’t know SEO, hire someone who can and does.</p>
<h3><strong>For the DIY agent:</strong></h3>
<p>Before putting your fingers to the keyboard, it’s important to understand who makes up your audience. What are their problems and goals? Knowing this will help keep you on-topic throughout your post.</p>
<p>Speaking of <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/how-to-never-run-out-of-blog-post-ideas/">topics</a> – coming up with them is the one aspect of blogging that stops agents, cold.</p>
<h4>Think about the questions you get from your clients and answer them in blog posts.</h4>
<p>Use community news items, tips for homeowners, buyer and seller tips, sources of down payment assistance and descriptions of the mortgage and buying/selling processes. Highlight local businesses – in fact, “The Five Best” of a business category posts are quite popular. For instance, “The Five Best Yoga Studios in Smallville.”</p>
<h4>Let the businesses know you’ve featured them on your blog and ask them to link to the piece from their social media pages.</h4>
<p>Another way to find topics is to check your Google Webmaster Tools to find the search terms people are using when they land on your site. These topics are also dynamite for <a href="https://www.searchenginewatch.com/2013/06/10/how-to-use-google-webmaster-tools-to-maximize-your-seo-campaign/">SEO</a>.</p>
<p>Links – both internal and outbound – throughout the post are important as well. Link to your own, relevant content and provide outbound links to quality articles that expand on your points.</p>
<p>Once you have that brilliant piece of blogging, promote it everywhere you can – especially across your social media platforms. These are the engines that drive eyes back to your website. That’s the goal, right?</p>
<p>2018 is going to be an interesting year in the real estate industry. We’ve already pointed out that <a href="/blog/2018-real-estate-trends-boomerang-buyers/">boomerang buyers</a> will be hitting the market and now you know that to attract leads, you need to pay more attention to your content with client testimonials, long-form neighborhood descriptions to help with search ranking, and the many benefits of blogging.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>This is the first article in a new series highlighting 2018 real estate trends.</h4>
<p>Judging by the scarcity of 2018 housing market forecasts, it’s safe to say that many feel it’s a bit early to be thinking about next year. We beg to differ.</p>
<p>You’re just a few months away from implementing that <a href="https://success.marketleader.com/l/42972/2017-09-26/655jdj">2018 business plan</a> (you are working on it, right?) and knowing where you’ll need to focus your marketing dollars and energy is critical.</p>
<p>To learn that, you’ll need, at minimum, an idea of what type of market you’re facing, who the major players will be and how you’ll reach them. You’ll also need to know what will work and what won’t in 2018.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks you’ll find trends to pay attention to and how you can best market your real estate business to ride the 2018 wave. Don’t forget to check back!</p>
<h3><strong>The 2018 Real Estate Market</strong></h3>
<p>If there is one thing most early forecasters agree on, it’s that home prices will continue to rise. Where they part ways, however, is how much they will rise, with some claiming 3.65 percent and others, such as <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170905006155/en/CoreLogic-US-Home-Price-Report-Shows-Prices-Up-6.7-Percent-in-July-2017">CoreLogic</a>, indicating “that home prices will increase by 5 percent,” from July of this year through July of 2018.</p>
<p>Either prediction is good news for real estate consumers, however, because both beat 2016’s heady increase of nearly 7 percent.</p>
<p>Mortgage rates are expected to increase as well. Back in late March, Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer told CNBC to expect two more rate hikes by the end of 2017. We got one of them in June and, in July, the Fed decided to hold off on another. But forecasters <a href="https://www.housingwire.com/articles/36546-fannie-mae-expect-fed-rate-hikes-in-june-and-december/">predict</a> the next one will hit in December.</p>
<p>Forecasting how high 2018 mortgage rates will climb is nearly impossible, although, back in April, the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) said that they expect the “benchmark 30-year rate to climb above the 5% threshold sometime around the middle of 2018,” according to Brandon Cornett at the <a href="http://www.homebuyinginstitute.com/news/mortgage-rate-forecast-for-april-754/">Home Buying Institute</a>.</p>
<p>So, yes, homes will become less affordable for those on the edge of the affordability envelope. Many will be knocked completely out of the buyer pool. But, have no fear – the boomerang buyers may just make up for the loss of the cash-strapped buyer.</p>
<h4><strong>Gear up your marketing for boomerang buyers.</strong></h4>
<p>While exact figures vary, the National Center for Policy Analysis estimates that as many as 10 million Americans were forced into foreclosure when the housing bubble burst. The effects of the Great Recession, which officially ended in June 2009, according to Investopedia, will finally ease for about 1.5 million of these Americans.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-53341" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Boomerang-Buyers-2018.jpg" alt="Boomerang Buyers " width="800" height="800" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://selling-guide.fanniemae.com/Selling-Guide/Origination-thru-Closing/Subpart-B3-Underwriting-Borrowers/Chapter-B3-5-Credit-Assessment/Section-B3-5-3-Traditional-Credit-History/1032994681/B3-5-3-07-Significant-Derogatory-Credit-Events-Waiting-Periods-and-Re-establishing-Credit-08-07-2019.htm">waiting period</a> after a foreclosure is seven years, measured from the completion date of the foreclosure action as reported on the credit report or other foreclosure documents provided by the borrower. If the borrower can document extenuating circumstances, the wait may be cut to three years.</p>
<p><strong>Get to know this group of potential buyers:</strong></p>
<p>Knowing your audience is half of the battle when it comes to marketing. From the content you offer up in your newsletters and on your website to the stories and videos you choose to share on social media, laser focusing your marketing efforts, especially early in the year, is critical.</p>
<h3>So, who are these buyers-on-the-rebound?</h3>
<p><strong>They need low down payment loans.</strong></p>
<p>“Comparisons of the buying preferences between boomerang buyers and traditional non-distressed, owner-occupied repeat buyers show that boomerang buyers are, on average, four times more likely to finance with FHA loans than the latter,” suggests <a href="https://www.corelogic.com/intelligence/find-stories/boomerang-buyers-making-a-gradual-return/">Kristine Yao at CoreLogic</a>.</p>
<p>Content geared toward these buyers should let them know that the mortgage process has changed since they purchased their last home. Remember, lending standards were beyond loose and they may even have bought the home with no down payment. They need to know that most mortgages require down payments today.</p>
<p>Information on the FHA loan process &#8212; how to get the lowest down payment in the program, how to buy a condo with an FHA-backed loan, how to find out if a condo community is FHA-approved – is valuable information to 2018’s boomerang buyer.</p>
<p><strong>They’ve been forgotten.</strong></p>
<p>Watch TV for any amount of time and you’ll see that <a href="/blog/the-truth-about-millennials-and-real-estate/">millennials </a>and baby boomers are the primary target for marketers. If you hope to attract the rebound buyer, however, you’ll be the one marketer in town who focuses on the forgotten generation, Gen X.</p>
<p>The average age of a homeowner who lost a home to foreclosure during the recession was 45, according to a report published by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. So, expect that your average boomerang buyer will likely be in his or her early 50s.</p>
<p>And, there’s proof that they’re already reentering the housing market, according to <a href="https://www.realtor.com/news/trends/generation-x-real-estate-comeback/">Realtor.com’s</a> Clare Trapasso. Members of Gen X are “the only generation to buy more homes last year than it did in the previous one.”</p>
<p>When choosing an agent, these tech-adept, pragmatic individuals want, <em>more than anything else</em>, proof that you’ll do what you say you’ll do, so include lots of testimonials and success stories in your marketing materials.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-53343 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Boomerang-Buyers.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="800" /></p>
<p>Get active on social media as well, because, according to <a href="https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/5-reasons-marketers-have-largely-overlooked-generation-x-170539/">Adweek’s</a> Robert Klara, 75 percent of Gen Xers routinely rely on social networks and online reviews when researching products and services.</p>
<p>Most of all, members of this generation are focused on their bonds with their children. Proving the value of homeownership by putting it in terms of <a href="https://www.marketingprofs.com/articles/2009/3116/marketing-to-the-new-gen-x">“protecting and nurturing”</a> their child’s future will appeal far better to them than other generations.</p>
<p><strong>They are currently renting.</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t currently market to tenants, make 2018 the year that you start. When doing this, your <a href="/solutions/crm/">real estate CRM</a> will be your most important tool, so dig into it and start focusing on more renters.</p>
<p>Target apartment complexes, condo and townhome communities. Aside from talking up the financial benefits of owning rather than renting, let them know about local, state and national down payment assistance programs. Ask your preferred lender to help you create charts or other visuals showing these potential buyers that they can own a home for the what they currently pay in rent.</p>
<p>“Tired of paying rent? Own a new home for $799/mo.” is an incredibly powerful message to someone who doesn’t know about the various programs available to homebuyers.</p>
<p>Keep boomerang buyers in mind as you put together your 2018 business plan. There is huge potential in this pool of opportunity.</p>
<p>We’re excited about the real estate industry in 2018 and the opportunities available to agents.
