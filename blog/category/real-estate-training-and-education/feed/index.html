										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After learning some best practices, your new perspective on cold calling may surprise you.</p>
<p>It gets a bad rap. But if you know what you’re doing, it’s less intimidating and more productive.</p>
<p>Regardless of what you’ve heard or imagined, real estate cold calling can still be an effective lead generation strategy. That’s true even though it is “old school,” and even if there are many ways to fail.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Why Cold Calling Is Still Worthy of Consideration</h2>
<p>If real estate cold calling seems like an old-fashioned strategy, that’s because it is. But like <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/real-estate-direct-mail/">direct mail marketing</a> and <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/door-knocking-real-estate/">door knocking</a>, there’s a reason it’s been a common sales tactic for as long as it has: it works.</p>
<p>Let’s be honest. Upon first glance, the statistics about how good of an ROI cold calling offers aren’t encouraging. For example, <a href="https://www.zippia.com/advice/cold-calling-statistics/">a recent study</a> indicated that roughly one in three prospects will pick up when you call, and only one percent of cold calls will lead to an appointment.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t show the whole picture. Because many top-performing agents consider cold calling to be an essential part of their business plan. They’ve filled their pipelines by “dialing for dollars,” and it’s led to serious commission income increases year after year.</p>
<p>This discrepancy seems to highlight an important point: Real estate cold calling isn’t just a numbers game. Success comes as a result of discipline, hard work, and a bit of technique. Not plugging away until you experience some random luck.</p>
<p>Top-performing agents know how to capitalize on the few opportunities they get. They know how to get warm leads out of cold calls. And that’s doable for you, too, as long as you follow some tried-and-true techniques.</p>
<p>So let’s dive into the best practices so you can be among the many expert agents who leverage cold calling to close more deals.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">8 Pro Tips for Real Estate Cold Calling</h2>
<h3 class="BlogH3">1. Understand the Law</h3>
<p>Cold calling in real estate isn’t foolproof. There are many ways it can go wrong. Getting into legal trouble is among the worst ways to fail.</p>
<p>The Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TPCA) was created in 1991 to protect consumers from pesky telemarketers. It applies to “any person, business, or entity that conducts telephone solicitations,” which includes real estate agents.</p>
<p>The TCPA is important to mention here because both the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have the regulatory powers to enforce it. The last thing you want as a result of trying to generate leads is a lawsuit.</p>
<p>And beware: today there are more than 220 million numbers on the FCC’s official <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/topics/do-not-call-registry">Do Not Call Registry</a>. If you call numbers on the registry, you could face a fine of up to <a href="https://www.rd.com/list/truth-about-do-not-call-list/">$40,000</a> for each call.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for you? Essentially it means you need to comply with the following:</p>
<ul class="BlogUL">
<li class="BlogLI">Restrict your calls to hours between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Be transparent: immediately tell the recipient who you are and the name of your business</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Don’t block your phone number from the recipient’s caller I.D.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Search the registry for every cold call you make to ensure you aren’t contacting anyone who’s on that list</li>
</ul>
<p>For more details about how to cold call in real estate without breaking the law, <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/telemarketing-cold-calling">check out NAR’s quick summary</a>.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">2. Prepare</h3>
<p>Do the proper research before you call so you can speak knowledgeably about your prospect’s situation and provide thorough responses to any questions that might come up. For example: if you’re cold calling a potential seller, familiarize yourself with the neighborhood, know the area’s <a href="https://www.realtor.com/research/market-trends/">median listing price</a>, and compile a handful of nearby listing comps for reference.</p>
<p>Prepare your lines beforehand. Use <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2022-Call-Scripts-Guide.pdf">the most effective real estate call scripts</a> and adjust them to fit your personality and the specific situation.</p>
<p>Then practice. Rehearse your main talking points. Call yourself and leave a voicemail to assess your delivery.</p>
<p>Ask a friend, family member, or colleague to play the role of an inquisitive consumer so you can practice fielding questions, addressing concerns, and handling objections. Work toward sounding as natural as possible.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">3. Resist the Urge To Sell</h3>
<p>Be relational, not salesy. No one wants to feel like they’re being used to boost your bottom line. So be friendly and provide value. Demonstrate that you actually care about them as a person.</p>
<p>How can you do that? By listening to what they say, taking notes, and repeating their own words back to them throughout the conversation. Tailor your approach specifically to their pain points and show how you’re the agent who can provide the help they need.</p>
<p>Your ultimate goal, of course, is to turn them into a client. But that’s not what this call is about. You’re not going to sign any contracts after a single phone call.</p>
<p>Instead, focus on being genuinely helpful, and replace your ultimate goal with a much smaller one for the time being: to get them to take the next step (which, for example, might be something as simple as scheduling a follow-up call).</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">4. Set a (Realistic) Daily Cold Calling Goal</h3>
<p>Aiming for 500 cold calls a day is admirable, but it’s also a recipe for burnout.</p>
<p>First, establish your commission income goals. Then determine how many calls you’ll need to get there.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say you want to earn $75,000 this year in commissions and you’re on a 10 percent split with your broker. That means you’ll need to close slightly less than $2.8 million worth of real estate sales. (The breakdown: $75,000 of total commissions income ÷ 90% to account for the split ÷ 3% if that’s the transaction commission rate.) If the median sale price of a home in your area was $285,000, you’d need to close 10 deals a year to reach (and slightly exceed) your commission goal.</p>
<p>(If you want the quickest, easiest way to find out how many leads you’ll need to reach your annual income goal, use Market Leader’s free <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/leadcalculator/">Lead Calculator</a>. Simply punch in the numbers you’re aiming for, and the calculator will tell you how many transactions and leads you’ll need across all lead sources.)</p>
<p>Also, this is where investing in your <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/solutions/crm/">CRM</a> pays off. Analyze the data it provides to determine how many contacts it took you to generate the deals you closed last year.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">5. Call at the “Right Time”</h3>
<p>If you still don’t feel all warm and fuzzy about real estate cold calling, consider getting it out of the way as soon as possible so you can avoid procrastinating. Many agents like to make telephone prospecting the first thing they do every morning so they can get it off their mind and their to-do list.</p>
<p>Is that the best time to call? It could be. But as long as you comply with the FCC’s limitations, of course, any time may be a good time for you and your prospects.</p>
<p>You could go the route of following the statistics. For example, findings from <a href="https://www.revenue.io/blog/the-best-time-to-cold-call-prospects-in-2020">one recent study</a> suggested that “decision makers are more likely to engage in the late afternoon,” with engagement rates peaking “during the 4-5 p.m. hour.” And data from <a href="https://www.execvision.io/blog/best-time-cold-call/">another study</a> showed that “the best time to cold call a prospect is between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., with 10 a.m. (15.53%) and 2 p.m. (15.01%) providing the best response times.”</p>
<p>Studies like those might provide a good starting point. But ultimately, you need to find what works best for you and your prospects. That’s going to require some trial and error.</p>
<p>Hypothesize about what might work best, give it a try, track your results, and repeat the process until you’ve found a time range that yields the highest results. Once you’ve identified the ideal times to call, make that a regular part of your schedule and stick to it.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">6. Demonstrate Your Value Immediately</h3>
<p>The prospect should immediately learn 1) who you are and 2) what you bring to the table. And they should know both of those things <em>before</em> they can even begin to consider objections.</p>
<p>Sharing who you are is easy – just start off the call by mentioning your name and, if applicable, the name of your business or brokerage. But how can you demonstrate your value?</p>
<ul class="BlogUL">
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Share a version of your unique value proposition</strong>, a statement that expresses how you’re different (and better!) than your competitors. (Don’t have one? <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/real-estate-marketing-plan/">Market Leader’s free real estate marketing plan</a> walks you through the process of creating a unique value proposition, vision statement, and mission statement.)</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Share your enthusiasm.</strong> Think of Theodore Roosevelt’s famous line: “Nobody cares how much you know until they know how much you care.” Demonstrating your level of expertise is very important (which is why it’s our next point), but it’s not the only thing that matters when cold calling – you also need to show that you have their best interest at heart. Your prospect is looking for an advocate and cheerleader, not just a consultant.</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Share what you know.</strong> By translating not only facts and figures but also your interpretation, insights, and conclusions based on the data, you’re essentially saying, “I’m the local expert, I’ve put in the hard work to understand this market at a granular level, and I’m bringing a kind of value that no other agent can provide.” It’s that kind of analysis that will put you leagues beyond what your prospects can find on Zillow.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="BlogH3">7. Be Memorable</h3>
<p>Not only are you competing with other agents, you’re also competing with all of the other things that take prospects’ time and attention away from buying or selling. So find your own unique way to stand out. Maybe for you it’s your personality, a catchphrase, a resource you provide, or a personal connection you share.</p>
<p>But remember: Ultimately, the call isn’t about you. It’s about helping the prospect. So as you’re capturing their attention, be careful not to push them aside. Always help your prospects draw a clear connection between what you do and how (exactly) that benefits them.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">8. Give Them the Next Steps</h3>
<p>After the call is over, they should know what’s going to happen next. End by scheduling a meeting, for example, or nailing down the best time for a follow-up call.</p>
<p>Is there a specific action you want them to take after the call? Tell them plainly. Depending on the situation, you might have one specific call to action (e.g., “Take a look at the listings on my website,” or “Check out this <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/what-is-a-cma-in-real-estate/">CMA</a> and let me know what you think”).</p>
<p>Or maybe the next step is something you will do (e.g., “I’m going to shoot you an email that walks you through the buying process…,” or “I’ll give you a call on Wednesday…”).</p>
<p>In any case, don’t end the call without providing clarity about who is doing what when.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are two ways to approach this.</p>
<p>You could create a real estate business plan to avoid failure. Many agents go that route and find some level of success. There’s nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p>But there’s another way. You could create a business plan, not just because it reduces the risk of failure, but because it maximizes your growth potential.</p>
<p>What follows is an invitation to do just that – to go through the process of refining intentionality, elevating accountability, and igniting motivation so you can be more productive. Year after year.</p>
<p>What if 2023 was the year you generated more leads and closed more deals than ever before? It’s possible. But only if you have a plan to follow.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">The Real Estate Business Plan Checklist</h2>
<p>To provide the big-picture view, here are the action items you’ll need to include in your plan for this year:</p>
<ul class="BlogUL">
<li class="BlogLI">Note learnings from 2022</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Calculate your expenses</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Set goals</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Create a marketing plan</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Develop a system for tracking your progress</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re going to take a close look at each. But if you want to hop on the fast track, download the <a href="#download">2023 Real Estate Business Plan</a> and you can get started right away. This free, interactive guide from Market Leader covers everything on that checklist and more. Plus, you’ll get downloadable templates for calculating expenses, setting goals, planning your marketing, and tracking progress.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">5 Year-End Reflection Questions To Consider</h2>
<p>Sometimes you have to look back before you can move forward. Use the questions below as a way to reflect on last year’s performance so you can identify your business’s strengths, weaknesses, and potential.</p>
<ol class="BlogOL">
<li class="BlogLI">Which aspects of my real estate business <strong>occupied most of my time and attention</strong> last year?</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Which aspects of my business <strong>performed best</strong> last year? (For example, maybe you received many referrals, responded quickly to leads, or executed a strong social media campaign.)</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Based on last year’s performance, which aspects of my business <strong>are most in need of improvement</strong>?</li>
<li class="BlogLI">What are the <strong>top two or three mistakes</strong> I made last year that I need to learn from for 2023?</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>What would “success” look like</strong> specifically for my business in 2023?</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Calculate Your Expenses</h2>
<p>Believe it or not, tracking your expenses is an important prerequisite to maximizing your gross commission income for 2023. If you have the right expense-tracking system in place, you’ll get more of your hard-earned income back at the end of the year.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to track all of your deductible business expenses. You may be surprised to learn about the <a href="https://outfront.kw.com/training/11-tax-deductions-every-real-estate-agent-should-know-about/">many ways you can reduce the amount you owe to the IRS</a>. For example, you might even be eligible to deduct expenses related to software, marketing, advertising, and lead generation. Refer to <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p535.pdf">IRS Publication 535</a> for details and be sure to consult with your CPA or financial advisor so you don’t miss out on any money-saving tips.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Two of the Best Ways to Track Your Expenses</h3>
<ul class="BlogUL">
<li class="BlogLI">Use an app. There are many free and low-cost options that allow you to categorize and track your expenses on the go. For example, check out <a href="https://www.spendee.com/">Spendee</a> or <a href="https://dollarbird.co/">Dollarbird</a>. They’re both simple and user-friendly, and they both have options to get you started for less than $5 per month.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Download the free “Expense Tracker” template in Market Leader’s <a href="#download">2023 Real Estate Business Plan</a>. It provides space for you to calculate your personal living expenses and all of your various business expenses all in one place.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Set Your Real Estate Business Goals</h2>
<p>Start by <strong>identifying your average commission per transaction</strong>. Multiply the <a href="https://www.realtor.com/research/market-trends/">median listing price in your area</a> by your commission percentage rate.</p>
<p>Once you’ve calculated your expenses and you’ve figured out roughly how much you’ll bring in from each transaction, you’ll be informed enough to establish an <strong>attainable income goal for 2023</strong>.</p>
<p>From there you can determine how many transactions you’ll need for the year.</p>
<p>The Formula: A ÷ B = C</p>
<p>A. Your 2023 Income Goal<br />
B. Estimated Commission Per Transaction<br />
C. Transactions Needed for the Year</p>
<p>To drill down even farther, check out Market Leader’s free <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/leadcalculator/">Lead Calculator</a>. Simply punch in the numbers you’re aiming for, and the calculator will tell you how many transactions and leads you’ll need across all lead sources to reach your income goal.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Create a Marketing Plan</h2>
<p>Maybe you’re on your way to “top-performer” status, but you don’t have a great plan for getting more clients and increasing your gross commission income. Or maybe you have a plan, but it’s not working.</p>
<p>Either way, you’ll benefit from learning how to <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/real-estate-marketing-plan/">craft a well-developed real estate marketing plan</a> that’s specifically designed to help you <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/products/real-estate-leads/">generate more leads</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick outline sketch of what that would look like in practical terms.</p>
<ul class="BlogUL">
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Build your brand.</strong> Establish a brand identity that includes a mission statement, vision statement, and a value proposition.</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Define your target market.</strong> You can’t be everything to everyone. If you try, your brand will end up blending in instead of standing out. So take the time to identify who fits within your audience.</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Collect data.</strong> When you’re armed with statistics, analytics, and insights, you’re better able to set goals, track progress, and make your success repeatable. Without data, your marketing efforts are more likely to be a complete gamble, if not a guessing game.</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Get marketing automation tools.</strong> With <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/products/professional-for-agents/">Market Leader Professional</a>, for example, you get a customizable, lead-generating website and a fully integrated CRM. Plus, you can automate new listing alerts and even create newsletters and content pieces like postcards, flyers, and video-enabled mobile-responsive emails.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Track Your Progress</h2>
<p>Why is performance-tracking necessary?</p>
<ul class="BlogUL">
<li class="BlogLI">It’s a way of <strong>holding yourself accountable</strong> to the goals you set.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">It provides you with the <strong>feedback</strong> you need to make strategic adjustments.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">It enables you to create <strong>new benchmarks</strong> for future goals.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">It takes the guesswork out of your <strong>professional self-reflection</strong>.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">It’s the most efficient way to <strong>spot what’s working well and what needs improvement</strong>.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">It helps you <strong>prioritize</strong> and keeps you focused on what matters most.</li>
</ul>
<p>It doesn’t have to be time-consuming and complicated. It can be as easy as creating a basic table in your favorite word processor or spreadsheet software, writing down all of your goals in the left column, and using the rest of the columns to note your performance each month (or week).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pictures can say a thousand words, but they can’t say everything. At some point, the power of language has to take over.</p>
<p><strong>The best real estate listing description examples you can find will all have one thing in common: they’ll all have compelling marketing copy that was crafted to <em>sell</em>, not just describe.</strong></p>
<p>If you’ve been overlooking the sales power of copy in your listing descriptions, welcome. You’re not the only one. Mediocre (if not flat out poor) descriptions are the norm. And that’s unfortunate. Because listing descriptions are extremely important.</p>
<p>Consumers are now more likely to search online for a home than ever before. According to a recent report from <a href="https://cdn.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/2022-home-buyers-and-sellers-generational-trends-03-23-2022.pdf">NAR</a>, “Among all generations of home buyers, the first step taken in the home search process was to look online for properties.”</p>
<p>Half of all buyers they surveyed (51%) said they found the home they purchased online. (Which is almost double the amount of those who said they found their home through their agent, by the way.)</p>
<p><strong>The point is, real estate listing descriptions matter. They may even matter a lot, especially if they’re done well.</strong></p>
<p>And the best part is, it’s not as if you have to spend a ton of time mastering the art and science of copywriting. All it takes to boost the selling power of your listing descriptions is a bit of know-how and some practice.</p>
<p>This article will walk you through exactly how to write descriptions that sell (and how not to write them). Then we’ll take a look at four real estate listing description examples from top-notch agents so you can see how it’s done.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">How To Write a Real Estate Listing Description</h2>
<p>Here are some best practices to keep in mind as you supercharge your listings with compelling marketing copy.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Start With the Seller</h3>
<p>As the agent, you can put pieces together and come up with some ideas about what you should highlight in the description. But the seller has a unique perspective on the home, and they know better than you do what it’s like to live there day to day. They’ll almost certainly raise excellent selling points that never would have occurred to you unless you had asked.</p>
<p>Find out what it was that originally caught their attention when they bought. What do they love about it? What will they miss when they sell?</p>
<p>Their favorite things about the home are likely to be the same things that will attract potential buyers. So before you work your marketing magic, get inspiration straight from the sellers themselves.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Write to Your Audience</h3>
<p>In other words, don’t write listing descriptions that only sound good to you and your client. Let it all revolve around potential buyers (and their agent).</p>
<p>Listing agents are, above all else, marketers. And marketers always determine a target buyer for their products before coming up with a plan.</p>
<p>We don’t see urban streetwear companies appealing to Gen X or Baby Boomers. Millennials aren’t likely to get targeted online ads from AARP. Yet the average listing description is a lot like the average real estate agent – trying to be all things to all people. That has never worked before, and it won’t work for you.</p>
<p>So before you write a word, put yourself in your prospects’ shoes. What will they want to hear? What are the kinds of things they’ll be looking for? Write their dream home into your copy.</p>
<p>What objections or fears might they have? Cut them off at the pass and address concerns head-on. Do they think it’s unaffordable? Talk about how easy financing can be.</p>
<p>Is it a family home with a large backyard and schools nearby? Speak directly to the parents. Is it a swanky uptown condo that looks like a status symbol? Speak to that millionaire entrepreneur looking for a home that doubles as an accessory.</p>
<p>Your listing descriptions need a personal flair that cater to the home buyers you’re trying to reach. Play into their vision, and make it clear that your listing is exactly what they’re looking for.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Craft a Killer Headline</h3>
<p>The amazing listing description you labored to create is worthless if no one reads it. And the best way to get potential buyers to read your description is to write a headline they can’t ignore, a headline that captures their attention and sets the tone for the entire listing.</p>
<p>The main purpose of the headline is to get them to read the first line of your description. And the main purpose of that first line is to get them to read your second line, and on and on it goes.</p>
<p>If you spent as much time crafting the headline as you did writing the description, it would be time well spent.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Think Like a Copywriter</h3>
<p>When you’re writing real estate listing descriptions, you’re writing to sell. At its core, what you’re doing here is no different than what legendary advertising experts like <a href="https://www.oneclub.org/hall-of-fame/-bio/david-ogilvy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">David Ogilvy</a> did for decades.</p>
<p>So don’t approach this task as a real estate agent filling in the blank on a form that says “Description”. Approach it as if you were Mad Men’s Don Draper penning irresistible marketing copy that turns heads and closes deals.</p>
<p>To make your “adman” impersonation believable, here are some quick-and-dirty tips for writing like a copywriter.</p>
<ul class="BlogUL">
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Lead with the benefits.</strong> Then move to the features. In other words, talk first about how the home will benefit the buyer, what problems it may solve for them, and why all of that matters. Then get into the specs and nitty-gritty details.</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Write like a human.</strong> Studies have proven over and over that simple, person-to-person writing is most effective. So say what you mean and keep it conversational. Read it out loud to test yourself – if it sounds like normal human speech, you’re on the right track!</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Be concise.</strong> Less is (often) more when it comes to writing marketing copy. Use powerful words that pack a punch instead of frivolous adverbs.</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Create a sense of urgency.</strong> Buyers know homes don’t stay on the market for long. Give them that extra nudge they need to take action now by <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/create-sense-of-urgency-in-prospect-roleplay">creating a sense of urgency</a>.</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>“Show, don’t tell.”</strong> Guide their daydreaming and create mental images. Why list the dimensions of the kitchen when you could say, “You can cook for 2 or 20 in this spacious, guest-friendly kitchen.” Instead of stating flatly that the ceilings are made of plaster, mention that they could “entertain beneath soaring Venetian plaster ceilings.”</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Don’t Do This When You Write Listing Descriptions</h2>
<p>Now you know how to write real estate listing descriptions. But here’s what not to do.</p>
<ul class="BlogUL">
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Don’t overthink it.</strong> Yes, your listing descriptions are important. But the stakes aren’t so high that you need to spend hours and hours crafting a perfect piece. Why? First, because it’ll take you way too long to write. And also because your writing will show that you overthought it, which will make it less effective.</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Don’t use clever or flowery language.</strong> Write plainly. This isn’t a novel. The words themselves shouldn’t steal the spotlight. Yes, think creatively, but don’t distract the prospect with pretty prose. It’s counterproductive and misses the point completely.</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Don’t repeat information.</strong> Space is valuable. Don’t waste it by repeating all of the details that show up in the listing details. Describe the property in a way that doesn’t tell them what they already know (e.g., lot size, year built, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>There are more blunders to avoid. <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/5-cringe-worthy-mistakes-experienced-agents-make-on-their-listings/">Learn about the five cringe-worthy mistakes experienced agents make on their listings.</a></p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">4 Creative Real Estate Listing Description Examples</h2>
<p>Glean wisdom from these four noteworthy listing description examples from expert real estate agents and let the inspiration begin.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">1. Evoke Settings &amp; Scenes</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-61763 " src="https://www.marketleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Cathedral.png" alt="Real estate listing description example #1" width="443" height="760" /></p>
<p>This first listing description example does a great job of using language to create mental images. For example, we imagine waking up in the loft suite, hosting a big party out on the deck, and huddling around the fire pit. Framing your listing descriptions in this way gets your prospects to “read between the lines” and see in their mind’s eye more than what appears in the copy. (Plus, this listing gets extra credit for ending with that perfect call to action!)</p>
<p>Well done, <a href="https://www.eastsidepropertysearch.com/listing/mlsid/185/propertyid/1997697/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aubie Pouncey</a>!</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">2. Pile Up All the Perks</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-61764" src="https://www.marketleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lynnwood.png" alt="Real estate listing description example #2" width="443" height="763" /></p>
<p>Notice how this listing description example heaps on the goodness. Just when you think it couldn’t get any better, it does. We learn immediately that it’s “better than new” in that fantastic opening line. As we read on, we hear about upgrade after upgrade, with the excitement-building repetition of the word “new”. By the end, it sets the prospect up to feel like the decision to make a move on this house is a no-brainer. Numerous renovations, great floor plan, “dramatic two story entry,” private yard, fantastic location… What more could you want!?</p>
<p>Thanks for showing us how it’s done, <a href="https://www.elizabethavery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elizabeth Avery</a>!</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">3. Show Authentic Enthusiasm</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-61765" src="https://www.marketleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bramble.png" alt="Real estate listing description example #3" width="443" height="761" /></p>
<p>The excitement is palpable. And yet, it doesn’t come across as contrived or cheesy. This home’s apparent uniqueness speaks for itself, and the copy in this third listing description example does a great job of emphasizing that fact. It leaves the reader feeling as if they just have to see it to believe it. It’s hard not to feel joyful when you read things like, “this home is nothing short of AMAZING,” and, “This location is one you just can’t recreate!” And as a side note, who doesn’t want to work with an agent with that kind of contagious energy!?</p>
<p>We can feel your beachside happiness all the way from here, <a href="https://www.peggyrowerealty.com/listing/mlsid/297/propertyid/900674/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peggy Rowe</a>!</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">4. Speak to the Heart of Your Audience With Laser-like Focus</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-61766 aligncenter" src="https://www.marketleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Scottsdale.png" alt="Real estate listing descriptions example #4" width="443" height="735" /></p>
<p>This final home listing description example demonstrates why it’s so important to understand your audience. If you have a thorough understanding of who your potential buyers are, what they care about, and what their pain points are, you’ll know exactly how to capture their hearts with your listing description. This example has a very clear target (buyers interested in downsizing; buyers who have prioritized convenience and simplicity; buyers looking for a vacation home, seasonal home, or a home they can feel comfortable leaving behind when they travel). And the entire listing description is centered on meeting their needs and addressing their concerns.</p>
<p>Thank you, <a href="https://www.pollyblackwell.com/listing/mlsid/8/propertyid/6477055/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polly Blackwell</a>! You nailed it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re writing real estate newsletters only because that’s what your competition is doing, then you’re doing it for the wrong reason. Your newsletter should support your overall marketing strategy. If it doesn’t, you could be wasting time, money, and energy.</p>
<p>That might seem like a daunting task at first. But don’t worry. With these five fail-safe marketing tips and five ideas for newsletter content, you’ll have all you need to create effective, compelling, and engaging newsletters.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">1. Identify Your Target Audience</h2>
<p>This is the most important step. And yet it’s the step that gets overlooked most often.</p>
<p>You can’t nail the bullseye if you don’t know where the target is. So before you do anything, think through <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/creating-a-target-market-for-your-real-estate-business/">the target market for your newsletters</a>. Then establish goals. What do you want your newsletters to accomplish as they relate to your overall marketing strategy?</p>
<p>It might be tempting to think you’re marketing to “everyone.” But real estate marketing strategies like that tend to be unfruitful. It’s been said many times, but it bears repeating: if you try to be all things to all people, you run the risk of not being anything to anyone.</p>
<p>Who are you trying to stay in contact with? Who are you trying to sell homes to? Are they retirees? First-time homebuyers? People purchasing investment properties? The more specific you can get, the better.</p>
<p>Depending on where you are on your journey as a real estate agent, this step might take some time. But developing a <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/the-7-essentials-of-real-estate-marketing-plans/">solid real estate marketing strategy</a> is always worth it.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">2. Tailor Your Newsletter to Your Target Audience’s Needs</h2>
<p>Don’t make the mistake of talking about yourself all the time. “I just sold this amazing house.” “Here’s why I’m the number one agent in the city.”</p>
<p>Of course, there’s nothing wrong with a little self-promotion here and there. But if it ever comes close to appearing that you are all you care about, you’ve gone too far.</p>
<p>Your readers probably already know how great you are. That may be why they subscribed to your newsletter to begin with! Ultimately, what they’re after is the benefit. They want to know what’s in it for them.</p>
<p>So gear all of your content (even your own promotional plugs) toward your reader and how they can benefit. Make it a habit to ask yourself these two questions as you craft your newsletter: “So what? Who cares?” Each section of every newsletter you send should provide answers to those questions.</p>
<p>Let’s get even more specific. Be sure to tailor your content according to the type of lead with whom you’re communicating. There&#8217;s no better way to get people to tune you out than to send them content that doesn&#8217;t relate to their needs. Have you taken steps to ensure your seller leads are only receiving content relevant for people considering selling their homes? What about for buyers?</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">3. Choose the Format</h2>
<p>Decide if you want a <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/make-print-marketing-part-of-your-strategy/">print</a> or <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/the-real-estate-guide-to-email-marketing-and-automation/">email</a> newsletter. (Or both!)</p>
<p>While print newsletters might cost more than emailing, they continue to perform well year after year. With <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/solutions/marketing-automation/">the right marketing tool</a>, they’re easier to create and print than you might think. Everything from designing to printing to shipping your print newsletters can be taken care of in a single system like Market Leader Professional.</p>
<p>Print newsletters can be just as effective as email newsletters (if not more so). Why? One of the main reasons is that the reach of direct mail tends to be more focused. It has less to compete with than email.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.usps.com/business/promotions/direct-mail-brochure.pdf">one report</a> indicated that the average person receives over 150 emails per day, whereas the average household receives only about two pieces of mail per day. Plus, print newsletters have staying power: they can easily be passed on, left in waiting rooms, or handed out in person. The con? Direct mail is less of a trackable medium than email, limiting your ability to monitor and track progress.</p>
<p>Email newsletters one the other hand are less expensive and even easier to create. And emails make it much easier for you to collect all of the data you want, monitor success, and iterate your strategy. But if you’re not careful, they can look like spam or get lost in the sea of other emails your prospects get on any given day.</p>
<p>Can’t decide? Go back to your overall marketing strategy. If your target audience consists of retirees, for example, a printed newsletter might best. If you’re aiming for relatively young first-time buyers, maybe it’s best to go the email route.</p>
<p>And remember, there isn’t necessarily a right or wrong answer. It’s about what works best for your particular audience.</p>
<p>You may even choose to do both. Reaching out to people with two mediums increases the likelihood that you connect with them. If you call someone every day at 1 p.m. and they don’t pick up, you should try calling at a different time. The same concept applies to newsletters: If you can’t connect with email, print might work.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">4. Pack Your Newsletter With Engaging Content</h2>
<p>Whether you go with print or email, it’s always important to stand out. Your number one newsletter content priority is to keep your reader engaged. Here are some general guidelines worth following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay special attention to the design elements and make it look appealing.<br />
Make it interesting and easy to read.</li>
<li>Be concise.</li>
<li>Provide relevant information about buying and selling and other related topics.</li>
<li>Provide research and insight with useful, compelling, and actionable data.</li>
<li>Include calls to action.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, make it valuable.</p>
<p>Personalizing your newsletter will make it stand out from the crowd. So write about topics that are interesting to you or that your target market will find informative. You are trying to connect with your audience, and there’s nothing that will lose that connection faster than a boring newsletter.</p>
<p>Need some inspiration on content themes for your real estate newsletters? Here are five ideas to jumpstart your imagination.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Idea #1: Inform</h3>
<ul>
<li>Customize your newsletter for each prospect. If you know where your prospect is searching, talk about interesting things happening in that area: new shopping centers opening up, schools that performed highly on state exams, local bars and restaurants with great reviews, etc. If you have too many prospects to manage something like this, customize your content according to your top five prospects’ personalities and interests.</li>
<li>Keep your prospects up to date with trends in interest rates, home values, and neighborhood stats.</li>
<li>Most consumers will be interested in listings. Take a few listings that are extremely interesting (customized to the prospect) and post them on your newsletter with a link back to your website. This keeps them engaged with you and off unrelated websites where they&#8217;ll run into other agents vying for their attention.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Idea #2: Offer Discounts to Local Businesses</h3>
<ul>
<li>This is a great way to add tangible value to your newsletter. But more than that, it shows that you have a variety of local connections, which can go a long way to boost your credibility as a real estate agent.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Idea #3: Make It Warm &amp; Relational</h3>
<ul>
<li>Express your personality (while always keeping it professional, of course).</li>
<li>Share pictures and personal updates.</li>
<li>Sure this is a nice idea. But it’s more than that. Adding a small relational component to your newsletter shows that you’re not just a sales shark hunting for your next closing.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Idea #4: Provide Helpful Advice</h3>
<ul>
<li>Position yourself as <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/3-tactics-to-position-yourself-as-the-neighborhood-expert/">the local expert</a>.</li>
<li>Do the work of analysis for them. Numbers, charts, and infographics are great, but always be sure to help your readers understand the data. Offer suggestions and draw conclusions.</li>
<li>Want to take your marketing strategy to the next level? Write a blog where you can share your expert opinion on trending topics in real estate and link your newsletter to it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Idea #5: Make It Fun</h3>
<ul>
<li>Include games, puzzles, amusing articles, contests, recipes, or funny cartoons and videos.</li>
<li>But remember: adding a touch of entertainment to an otherwise boring newsletter isn’t “just for fun.” If it’s done well, it can be extremely useful in helping you establish a connection with your leads.</li>
</ul>
<p>First we considered the importance of developing a real estate marketing strategy, establishing your target audience, and tailoring your newsletter to fit your readers’ needs. Then we saw five of the best newsletter ideas that will jumpstart your content creation journey. That’s a great foundation.</p>
<p>But if you’re looking for the best way to maximize efficiency and elevate your CRM toolkit as a real estate agent, you won’t want to miss this fifth and final marketing tip.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">5. Use a Marketing Automation Tool</h2>
<p>The best <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/real-estate-marketing-automation/">real estate marketing automation tools</a> allow you to save time and energy on marketing to your contact database, which in turn frees you up to serve your clients.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/products/professional-for-agents/">Market Leader Professional</a>, for example, you’ll be able to create (and automate) effective newsletters that bring value to both you and your contacts. Plus, you’ll get a customizable website, a fully-integrated CRM, and all of the marketing automation you’ll need to take your business to the next level.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a real estate agent, you may occasionally hear that you’re a “consultant.” But don’t fall for it. You’re a salesperson.</p>
<p>And that means you need to be an expert at finding people to sell to. In other words, you need to have an expert-level understanding of real estate prospecting strategies.</p>
<p>The most successful agents have a firm grasp of lead generation fundamentals. But they also know how to think creatively, innovate, and leverage unconventional methods.</p>
<p>So to add some new tools to your toolbox, here’s a list of 13 beyond-normal prospecting ideas that will help you generate more business. Not just tomorrow but year over year.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">1. Partner With Flippers</h2>
<p>“Flippers” are investors who buy homes for the purpose of rehabbing and reselling (i.e., “flipping” homes). There are many roles a flipper has to juggle. And while they may sometimes be a “jack of all trades,” they often need help from a master of real estate sales. That’s you.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/working-with-the-investor-client-10-tips-for-success/">Flippers and real estate agents</a> can develop a partnership that’s both complementary and mutually beneficial.</p>
<p>What’s in it for them? You can provide valuable information about the local market, list and market their properties, negotiate with buyers and sellers, and manage all of the transaction paperwork.</p>
<p>What’s in it for you? In a word: prospects. When you become a flipper’s go-to agent, you’re expanding your network, doubling your reach – and best of all – creating a passive mode of lead generation. Their prospects are your prospects. And their closings become your closings.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">2. Assist With Relocation Services</h2>
<p>For a variety of reasons, corporations and government agencies sometimes relocate their employees to a different city, state, or province. You can be the real estate agent who helps both the business and their employees with the move.</p>
<p>There are two main ways to start acquiring relocation referrals.</p>
<p>One option is to partner with companies who are in a related field. Reach out to movers, storage facilities, and local relocation service providers.</p>
<p>And a second option is to reach out to the HR teams at large employers in your area and offer to help with their relocation services. If you land that kind of a partnership, you’ll have opened for yourself a reliable stream of leads who are highly motivated and ready to both buy and sell.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">3. Get Referrals Through Your CPA</h2>
<p>Like real estate agents, certified public accountants (CPAs) often have a large network. Their client profiles are very similar to those of your target market. And chances are, the topic of real estate – buying, selling, or investing – is a regular part of their day-to-day conversations.</p>
<p>The idea here is to make it so that you’re the name that gets dropped whenever those conversations happen. They’re in a prime position to give high-quality referrals.</p>
<p>Start by getting in touch with the best CPA in your area and becoming their client. By doing so, you’ll increase the likelihood that they’ll pass any prospects on to you when the moment is right.</p>
<p>And besides, talking with a CPA offers more than one benefit. Every real estate agent could use some tax help, right?</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">4. Call Expired Listings</h2>
<p>Of course, sellers never want to see their listing expire. It’s demoralizing. And this is where you come in as the hero of second chances. You can turn what feels like a dead end into a win-win.</p>
<p>Start this process by finding recently-expired listings using your MLS dashboard. (You can filter by the “expired” status and entering a date range.) But you don’t have to exclusively focus on recent listings – you can even target those which expired up to a few years ago.</p>
<p>It’s possible that the would-be sellers simply aren’t aware of how they could benefit by relisting. Or maybe the agent they worked with listed their home at an unreasonable asking price. It could be that all they need is an agent like you who can restore their confidence.</p>
<p>In sensitive situations like this, it can be difficult to know what to say at first. <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/expired-listing-scripts/">Get all the help you need with the best expired listing scripts.</a></p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">5. Target FSBOs in Your Neighborhood</h2>
<p>Pursuing “for sale by owner” (FSBO) listings is one of the best ways to prospect in real estate.</p>
<p>Because FSBOs aren’t just warm leads. They’re among the warmest of all real estate leads.</p>
<p>That may surprise you, but it’s not too bold of a claim. Here’s why. Most likely, they’re dealing with several obstacles and they’ve become all too aware of how difficult it is to sell on their own. They’re ready for help.</p>
<p>But that’s not to say it’ll be easy to convince them to work with you. It often requires some degree of research, negotiation, and persistence.</p>
<p>So how do you turn “for sale by owner” into “for sale by you”?</p>
<p>You can find FSBO listings on sites like ForSaleByOwner.com or Zillow.</p>
<p>First, gather as much information as you can about the lead and the listing’s background.</p>
<p>Then give them a call. Show them that you’re competent, capable, and the obvious person to work with if they decide to list with an agent instead. <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/best-fsbo-scripts/">Here are the seven best FSBO scripts for real estate agents.</a></p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">6. Become a Thought Leader in Your Community</h2>
<p>Go to a neighborhood board or city council meeting. Not just to attend but to speak up on issues that you genuinely care about.</p>
<p>Why did this make it on the list of real estate prospecting ideas? There are at least two good reasons. (Besides the fact that you have an authentic concern for the topic, of course.)</p>
<p>First, it’s a great way to spread the word about your business. Gatherings like these are full of leads and high-quality referral sources.</p>
<p>Word of mouth advertising is still highly effective. And placing yourself on center stage in a large public forum is a great way to get people talking.</p>
<p>And second, it helps you establish credibility in your area. It shows the attendees that you aren’t a one-dimensional sales shark.</p>
<p>For example, championing the creation of a new park or something as simple as the fixing of a notoriously-potholed street shows that you’re a knowledgeable and trustworthy member of the community. And that you have a vested interest in the wellbeing of your neighborhood and city.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">7. Talk to Your Neighbors</h2>
<p>Is this an “old school” approach to prospecting? Yes.</p>
<p>But is it outdated? Absolutely not. And it never will be.</p>
<p>Sometimes it’s easy for agents to get so absorbed in abstract prospecting strategies that they forget to see who’s right in front of them.</p>
<p>So walk down the street in your own neighborhood. Introduce yourself to every resident. Let them know (formally or casually) that you’re a real estate agent.</p>
<p>Of course not every conversation will lead to you getting a new client right away. But the personal connections you’ll make along the way are invaluable.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newhomecobroker.com/">David Fletcher</a>, a real estate broker and writer, suggests using this language: “As you can see (on my badge or Realtor pin), I am in real estate and I was wondering if you may know someone who might be wanting to buy or sell a home?”</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">8. Set up a Face Painting Booth at a Local Fair or Community Event</h2>
<p>If face painting isn’t your thing, hire an art student who could do it for you. Or set up a different kind of booth altogether. Don’t miss the point here. It doesn’t matter what kind of booth you have.</p>
<p>The idea is to plant yourself in a lighthearted environment full of people who fit within your target market. And to do it in a way that’s fun and unrelated to real estate.</p>
<p>Use the face-to-face interactions you host at your booth as a chance to open up conversations about who you are, what you do, and how you can help them buy or sell. Be sure to collect contact information and conduct follow-ups the next day.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">9. Use a Survey to Generate Leads</h2>
<p>You want to know more about your prospects. And you want to generate leads. A well-designed survey can help you do both simultaneously.</p>
<p>Done right, a survey can serve two purposes. It allows you to capture valuable, exclusive data about your prospects, leads, and/or clients (that your competition won’t have access to!). And it functions as a powerful lead generation tool.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can create a survey to function as a prospecting tool.</p>
<p>Design it with <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/your-free-account-is-waiting/">SurveyMonkey</a> or <a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/free-account/">Qualtrics</a>. (They both offer free plans.) And send it to everyone on your contacts list.</p>
<p>To go a step farther, create a separate survey that’s specifically designed for cold traffic and prospects who aren’t on your contacts list. And post invitations to that survey on your website.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">What kinds of questions to ask:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Capture basic demographic information. Get to know who your prospects are in terms of their age, location, income, household size, and any other qualities that would provide useful insight for your marketing strategy.</li>
<li>Ask about their level of interest in buying and selling.</li>
<li>Ask questions to understand what kind of real estate agent would be most helpful to them.</li>
<li>Find out where they are in their home-buying and home-selling journey. Are they homeowners? Are they first-time buyers? How many properties do they have?</li>
<li>Find out if they have a real estate agent (if they’re not already working with you).</li>
<li>Include close-ended questions that have <a href="https://mwcc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Likert-Scale-Response-Options_MWCC.pdf">Likert scale response options</a>.</li>
<li>Include open-ended questions where respondents can write candidly and say whatever they want to say.</li>
<li>Learn about their general interests and hobbies.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="BlogH3">How to ask your questions:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Be as neutral and unbiased as possible.</li>
<li>Be genuinely curious. Today’s respondents are smart enough to sense the difference between a good survey and a bad survey. We’ve all taken a “survey” that we quickly learned was just a gimmicky sales tactic. Or a “quiz” that was really just a name-capture tool.</li>
<li>Start broad and get more specific as you go.</li>
<li>Ask one question at a time. Don’t cram two questions into one.</li>
<li>Make it easy for them to share their honest thoughts and opinions.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="BlogH2">10. Teach a Real Estate Course or Workshop</h2>
<p>Are all of these true for you?</p>
<ul>
<li>You have at least some level of expertise and experience as a real estate agent</li>
<li>You genuinely want to help people learn about a real estate-related topic</li>
<li>You enjoy teaching</li>
<li>You have the ability to carve out some time in your schedule</li>
</ul>
<p>If so, then teaching a real estate course or workshop doubles as an excellent real estate prospecting strategy.</p>
<p>Choose a subject that 1) you’d feel comfortable teaching and 2) will attract your ideal clientele. Maybe for you that looks like teaching a “Home Buying 101” course for first-time homebuyers, for example. Or teaching the fundamentals of real estate investments or flipping houses. After just a few minutes of thought, you could come up with plenty of other ideas on your own.</p>
<p>Once you’ve settled on your subject, consider the forum that would work best for you. <a href="https://www.becomealocalleader.com/marketing-tips/5-tips-hosting-webinar-buyers-sellers/">Host a webinar</a> or teach an online course. Or check with your local library or community center for in-person opportunities.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">11. Contact Every Warm Lead You Have</h2>
<p>No need to overthink this one. Just do it: Contact everyone on your warm leads list. (If you don’t have one, create one.)</p>
<p>Call even “those” contacts, the ones you’ve written off for some reason. Even those you thought were “too small” to call.</p>
<p>The objective here isn’t to close a deal on every call. It’s simply to make contact.</p>
<p>So your pitch doesn’t have to be formal. And you don’t even have to make a pitch! It could be as simple as checking in to see if they’d like to meet you for coffee or lunch.</p>
<p>Be yourself, be genuine, and focus on re-engaging with everyone on your warm leads list. This is real estate prospecting at its finest.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">12. Attend Networking Events</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/3-essential-networking-tips-for-agents/">Networking</a> is crucial for real estate agents. And even the most connected real estate agents need to widen their sphere of influence from time to time.</p>
<p>Among the quickest ways to build a solid connection base is to attend an event that has networking as its sole purpose. And while you’re there, be a card-taker, not a card-giver. Spend time during the next day following up with everyone you met.</p>
<p>The obvious place to start is by looking for conferences, events, and meetups that connect you with your target market. But you should also look for those that connect you with local business owners, contractors, investors, landscapers, real estate marketing experts, and anyone else who could become part of your team.</p>
<p>The network-building possibilities become even greater when you consider the many events and communities that are available online, such as Facebook Groups, for example.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">13. Get Exclusive Online Real Estate Leads</h2>
<p>Any list of real estate prospecting strategies would be incomplete without the mention of exclusive online real estate leads.</p>
<p>The key word here is “exclusive.” Some companies allow you to buy shared leads, which means they send the same leads you purchased to multiple agents simultaneously. But the better option is to go for exclusive leads because every lead that’s generated on your behalf is sent to one and only one agent – you!</p>
<p>With Market Leader, one flat monthly rate buys you a minimum number of exclusive buyer and seller leads in your desired areas every month. Guaranteed.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-33821" title="Real estate investor" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/investor-200x300.jpg" alt="Tips for real estate agents on how to work with investors" width="200" height="300" />Many new real estate agents dream of tapping into a network of investors who constantly buy and sell homes, imagining that it will provide an easy route to commissions and repeat business.</p>
<p>But when they actually hook an investor client—or<em> think</em> that they have—then, it’s often a different story.</p>
<p>Here’s the deal: The investment property sale is a very different process than a residential sale to an owner-occupant. With owner-occupants, you are selling the dream. You’re selling the home-sweet-home, the pitter-patter-of-little-feet, the cinnamon-in-the-kitchen, hearth-and-home fantasy ideal. Tap into that dream and the client’s bought it.</p>
<p>With investors, it’s a whole different ballgame. The successful investor has ice water in his or her veins. You’re not selling a dream; you’re selling ROI. If the number is there and it beats the investor’s hurdle rate, <em>and</em> you get the timing right, then you should have a sale.</p>
<p>But hitting that hurdle rate is <em>hard—</em>especially with an agent’s full commission thrown in the mix.</p>
<p>What’s more, lots of people will blow smoke, calling themselves “investors.” They will get you to do a ton of unpaid legwork for them, when in reality they’re all hat and no cattle. They either don’t have the capital to do the deal, or they are looky-loos and tire-kickers, or they’re just emotionally unable to pull the trigger on a property, no matter how much financial sense it makes.</p>
<p>Yes, investors can be lucrative clients for some. But it isn’t a market for everybody. Here are 10 success strategies for working with investors as a real estate agent:</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">1. Know the Basics</h2>
<p>The investor market is all about efficiency. Margins are compressed and commissions are frequently squeezed in the process. This isn’t the market for agents who need a lot of handholding, or for those who take a lot of time at each point of the transaction to get it right. You should come into the game already knowing how to block, tackle, throw and catch.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">2. Learn the Language</h2>
<p>Investors speak a different language than folks in the conventional residential real estate world, where you’re marketing houses to owner-occupants. You need to understand terms like “<a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hurdlerate.asp">hurdle rate,”</a> “<a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalizationrate.asp">cap rate</a>,” “<a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irr.asp">internal rate of return”</a> and “income vs. capital gains,” and have a solid understanding of how 1031 exchanges work. Your knowledge of real estate math has to be deeper than just a mortgage calculator.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">3. Speed Is Essential</h2>
<p>Time is money. Investor clients want answers quickly and they want their paperwork done quickly. You should have the bandwidth available to get the paperwork done fast, or have the staff available to do a first rate job.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">4. Limit Engagement on the Front End</h2>
<p>The best investors probably don’t need you to send them MLS listings—they’re beating the streets to find properties and motivated buyers <em>before</em> they come up on the MLS! For this reason, some investors will just need to hand you the football for the offer process. Since your front-end work is reduced, it may make sense to give up something in commissions.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">5. Never Offer too Much</h2>
<p>Never give away the store just to get an investor deal. <strong>Get something in return.</strong> If you give up commission percentage in order to get a deal, make sure to get a commitment to represent the investor on the other side when he or she lists the house.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">6. Prequalify the Investor</h2>
<p>Where is the money coming from? Do they have their own money? Are they preapproved? It’s best to have a business meeting up front. You don’t have to be too nosy, but you do have the right to ensure that you won’t get caught doing a lot of legwork for nothing because they can’t get financing for the properties they bid on.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">7. Leverage Your E&amp;O Policy</h2>
<p>Don’t forget that you have a card to play, too. Whether they realize it or not, sellers benefit from your errors and omissions insurance policy. That policy doesn’t just protect you; it also protects the owners you work with. If nothing else, that coverage is worth a percent or two. It can be a powerful argument against a seller who is flirting with the idea of a for-sale-by-owner approach. Owners looking to circumvent using a licensed real estate professional may pocket the commission—but they are taking on <em>all </em>of the liability, too.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">8. Only Work With Pros</h2>
<p>Make sure you’re working with mature individuals—not just some yahoos who want to alienate the market by making ridiculously low-ball offers on property after property, hoping to find a desperate seller by pure luck. They may succeed, but only by making you go through a lot of time and hassle on the front end, and possibly souring the market—not just for them, but for you as well, because you become associated with low-balling clients.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">9. Ask “How, Exactly, can I Help?”</h2>
<p>An investor client may have some tasks in mind that are quite different than your traditional role. He may want to handle offers and have you strictly handling paperwork. He may want your broker’s license to handle renting and leasing. He may just want you as a consultant—especially if he’s a new investor. It may be something different altogether. It’s much better to establish the scope of the engagement at the beginning of the process than at the end of it. Concentrate on finding sustainable, win-win solutions up front. The best investors want that, too, and will appreciate finding a reliable partner in their real estate practice.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">10. Present Listings the Proper Way</h2>
<p>Don’t give an investor client the same glossy presentation binder you give to everyone else. They’ll throw it in the trash. Those things are designed for the retail buyer, not the investor who buys wholesale. Investors would rather work things out on the back of a bar napkin with someone who “gets it” than receive a 30-page, glossy computer-generated “proposal” on the agency’s house software program with someone who doesn’t.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/working-with-investors-real-estate-agent/">How to Work With Investors as a Real Estate Agent</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Holes in Real Estate Training And How to Fill Them </strong></h1>
<p>If you consider your continuing education courses to be “real estate training,” you’re missing an amazing opportunity to increase your knowledge of real estate and, thus, increase your market share.</p>
<p>Yes, CE courses are mandatory, but they are in no way training you to be a better agent. They won’t help you to be a better negotiator, to market homes or to efficiently and successfully work with buyers.</p>
<p>That education is up to you to pursue. Or, you can choose not to bone up on the truly important stuff and be a mediocre player in your chosen profession.</p>
<h2>Master marketing.</h2>
<p>Real estate schools and real estate brokers aren’t known for teaching agents how to market homes. It’s why there are so many “list and pray” listing agents out there and why so many homes languish in buyers’ markets.</p>
<p>Sure, you can follow the crowd, copying what other listing agents are doing. But if what they’re doing isn’t working for them, what makes you think it will work for you?</p>
<p>Then, there’s your business marketing. If you are early in your career, learning how to market yourself and your services is paramount to not only making a living but building a referral base to keep you going down the line.</p>
<p>If you’re past the rookie stuff, how are you differentiating yourself from the rest of the agents in town?</p>
<p>Marketing is one of the biggest holes in real estate training. And, when the day is consumed with generating and following up on real estate leads and servicing existing clients, who has time to fill that hole?</p>
<p>But, fill it you must, and, with just a few hours a week you can learn how to become a better marketer and move away from the pack of the more complacent agents in town.</p>
<p>The Digital Marketing Institute offers marketing courses with certificates upon completion. If I were interviewing listing agents, the Certified Digital Marketing Specialist is going to impress far more than the agents with those NAR designation abbreviations trailing their names.</p>
<p>Download the brochure at <a href="https://digitalmarketinginstitute.com/students/courses/professional-certificate-in-digital-marketing-usa">DigitalMarketingInstitute.com</a>. The courses are pricey but they offer financing and, remember that the cost is most likely tax deductible.</p>
<p>Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management offers Digital Marketing Strategies &#8212; an online, go-at-your-own-pace course. Learn more <a href="https://online.em.kellogg.northwestern.edu/digital-marketing-strategies">here</a>.</p>
<p>Check with your association too, since they often offer marketing courses.</p>
<p>If you just can’t find the time to take classes, learn by reading.</p>

<h2>Hire a coach.</h2>
<p>If stars the caliber of Brad Pitt and Halle Berry use coaches, perhaps real estate agents can benefit from hiring a one too? Just a thought, but if you’re struggling to learn different aspects to running your business, a coach may just be the answer.</p>
<p>We recently covered the whole <a href="/blog/why-every-agent-should-get-real-estate-coaching/">real estate coach thing, in detail.</a> In a nutshell, a coach can help you improve various aspects of your business and how to attract clients.</p>
<p>Some real estate coaches are generalists, such as the brilliant <a href="https://goborino.com/">Borino</a>, while others, like <a href="https://www.floydwickman.com/">Floyd Wickman</a>, specialize in just a few aspects of the real estate business.</p>
<p>Then, there are the different ways you can receive your coaching. <a href="https://craigproctor.com/">Craig Proctor</a>, for instance, offers webinars, one-on-one coaching and more. Many coaches offer phone support.</p>
<p>All Market Leader customers have access to the <a href="/resources/million-dollar-pipeline-program/">Million Dollar Pipeline Program</a>, an exclusive real estate coaching program that provides tools and techniques to exceed transaction goals and scale your business with on-demand webinars, scripts, templates, and a closed Facebook group with access to top-performing agents and peers.</p>
<p>Or consider <a href="https://www.score.org/find-mentor">free business mentoring</a> from a retired executive. You’ll find that and more at your local SCORE office.</p>
<p>SCORE also offers free <a href="https://www.score.org/content/take-workshop">online workshops</a>.</p>
<h2>Learn how to efficiently run a small business.</h2>
<p>Knowing how to run a small business is undoubtedly another hole in your real estate education. From business and marketing plans to budgets, hiring and all the other details you’re responsible for, learning more about small business success is vital.</p>
<p>There are a variety of ways to get started backfilling this hole in your education. The <a href="https://www.sba.gov/sba-learning-platform">U.S. Small Business Administration</a> offers a number of online courses. Here are examples of some of the free, online courses offered:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://learn.sba.gov/learning-center-plan/learning-center-how-to-write-a-business-plan#course-content">How to Write a Business Plan</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sba.gov/document/report--customer-service-plan">Customer Service</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sba.gov/media/training/sba_intro_to_acct_09012016/index.html">Introduction to Accounting</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Or, check out the free online courses at <a href="https://www.kutztown.edu/about-ku/administrative-offices/small-business-development-center/resources/free-online-learning-programs.html">Kutztown University</a>. Some of the courses we found most interesting and pertinent for real estate agents include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assessing Your Company&#8217;s Financial Needs</li>
<li>Managing your Cash Flow</li>
<li>Creating Financial Projections</li>
</ul>
<h2>Negotiate like a champ.</h2>
<p>Negotiation skills are an important aspect of being successful in real estate. You’ll find a list of online courses that will help you become a better negotiator and communicator (some provide certificates upon completion) from education giants such as <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/negotiation">Yale</a>, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/influencing-people">University of Michigan</a> and <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/understanding-arguments">Duke University</a>.</p>
<p>Sure, riparian rights and the different ways of holding title are important things to know for real estate agents and real estate school provides that knowledge.</p>
<p>But when it comes to running a small business, marketing your services and your clients’ listings, and negotiating on their behalf for the best deal, you’ll need to look elsewhere for knowledge.</p>
<p>Thankfully, you can find it online, in books, podcasts and videos. Now, you just need to find the time, right?</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/holes-in-real-estate-training/">Beyond Continuing Education: Holes in Real Estate Training</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.marketleader.com">Market Leader</a>.]]></content:encoded>
