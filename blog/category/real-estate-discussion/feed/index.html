										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After learning some best practices, your new perspective on cold calling may surprise you.</p>
<p>It gets a bad rap. But if you know what you’re doing, it’s less intimidating and more productive.</p>
<p>Regardless of what you’ve heard or imagined, real estate cold calling can still be an effective lead generation strategy. That’s true even though it is “old school,” and even if there are many ways to fail.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Why Cold Calling Is Still Worthy of Consideration</h2>
<p>If real estate cold calling seems like an old-fashioned strategy, that’s because it is. But like <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/real-estate-direct-mail/">direct mail marketing</a> and <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/door-knocking-real-estate/">door knocking</a>, there’s a reason it’s been a common sales tactic for as long as it has: it works.</p>
<p>Let’s be honest. Upon first glance, the statistics about how good of an ROI cold calling offers aren’t encouraging. For example, <a href="https://www.zippia.com/advice/cold-calling-statistics/">a recent study</a> indicated that roughly one in three prospects will pick up when you call, and only one percent of cold calls will lead to an appointment.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t show the whole picture. Because many top-performing agents consider cold calling to be an essential part of their business plan. They’ve filled their pipelines by “dialing for dollars,” and it’s led to serious commission income increases year after year.</p>
<p>This discrepancy seems to highlight an important point: Real estate cold calling isn’t just a numbers game. Success comes as a result of discipline, hard work, and a bit of technique. Not plugging away until you experience some random luck.</p>
<p>Top-performing agents know how to capitalize on the few opportunities they get. They know how to get warm leads out of cold calls. And that’s doable for you, too, as long as you follow some tried-and-true techniques.</p>
<p>So let’s dive into the best practices so you can be among the many expert agents who leverage cold calling to close more deals.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">8 Pro Tips for Real Estate Cold Calling</h2>
<h3 class="BlogH3">1. Understand the Law</h3>
<p>Cold calling in real estate isn’t foolproof. There are many ways it can go wrong. Getting into legal trouble is among the worst ways to fail.</p>
<p>The Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TPCA) was created in 1991 to protect consumers from pesky telemarketers. It applies to “any person, business, or entity that conducts telephone solicitations,” which includes real estate agents.</p>
<p>The TCPA is important to mention here because both the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have the regulatory powers to enforce it. The last thing you want as a result of trying to generate leads is a lawsuit.</p>
<p>And beware: today there are more than 220 million numbers on the FCC’s official <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/topics/do-not-call-registry">Do Not Call Registry</a>. If you call numbers on the registry, you could face a fine of up to <a href="https://www.rd.com/list/truth-about-do-not-call-list/">$40,000</a> for each call.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for you? Essentially it means you need to comply with the following:</p>
<ul class="BlogUL">
<li class="BlogLI">Restrict your calls to hours between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Be transparent: immediately tell the recipient who you are and the name of your business</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Don’t block your phone number from the recipient’s caller I.D.</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Search the registry for every cold call you make to ensure you aren’t contacting anyone who’s on that list</li>
</ul>
<p>For more details about how to cold call in real estate without breaking the law, <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/telemarketing-cold-calling">check out NAR’s quick summary</a>.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">2. Prepare</h3>
<p>Do the proper research before you call so you can speak knowledgeably about your prospect’s situation and provide thorough responses to any questions that might come up. For example: if you’re cold calling a potential seller, familiarize yourself with the neighborhood, know the area’s <a href="https://www.realtor.com/research/market-trends/">median listing price</a>, and compile a handful of nearby listing comps for reference.</p>
<p>Prepare your lines beforehand. Use <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2022-Call-Scripts-Guide.pdf">the most effective real estate call scripts</a> and adjust them to fit your personality and the specific situation.</p>
<p>Then practice. Rehearse your main talking points. Call yourself and leave a voicemail to assess your delivery.</p>
<p>Ask a friend, family member, or colleague to play the role of an inquisitive consumer so you can practice fielding questions, addressing concerns, and handling objections. Work toward sounding as natural as possible.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">3. Resist the Urge To Sell</h3>
<p>Be relational, not salesy. No one wants to feel like they’re being used to boost your bottom line. So be friendly and provide value. Demonstrate that you actually care about them as a person.</p>
<p>How can you do that? By listening to what they say, taking notes, and repeating their own words back to them throughout the conversation. Tailor your approach specifically to their pain points and show how you’re the agent who can provide the help they need.</p>
<p>Your ultimate goal, of course, is to turn them into a client. But that’s not what this call is about. You’re not going to sign any contracts after a single phone call.</p>
<p>Instead, focus on being genuinely helpful, and replace your ultimate goal with a much smaller one for the time being: to get them to take the next step (which, for example, might be something as simple as scheduling a follow-up call).</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">4. Set a (Realistic) Daily Cold Calling Goal</h3>
<p>Aiming for 500 cold calls a day is admirable, but it’s also a recipe for burnout.</p>
<p>First, establish your commission income goals. Then determine how many calls you’ll need to get there.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say you want to earn $75,000 this year in commissions and you’re on a 10 percent split with your broker. That means you’ll need to close slightly less than $2.8 million worth of real estate sales. (The breakdown: $75,000 of total commissions income ÷ 90% to account for the split ÷ 3% if that’s the transaction commission rate.) If the median sale price of a home in your area was $285,000, you’d need to close 10 deals a year to reach (and slightly exceed) your commission goal.</p>
<p>(If you want the quickest, easiest way to find out how many leads you’ll need to reach your annual income goal, use Market Leader’s free <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/leadcalculator/">Lead Calculator</a>. Simply punch in the numbers you’re aiming for, and the calculator will tell you how many transactions and leads you’ll need across all lead sources.)</p>
<p>Also, this is where investing in your <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/solutions/crm/">CRM</a> pays off. Analyze the data it provides to determine how many contacts it took you to generate the deals you closed last year.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">5. Call at the “Right Time”</h3>
<p>If you still don’t feel all warm and fuzzy about real estate cold calling, consider getting it out of the way as soon as possible so you can avoid procrastinating. Many agents like to make telephone prospecting the first thing they do every morning so they can get it off their mind and their to-do list.</p>
<p>Is that the best time to call? It could be. But as long as you comply with the FCC’s limitations, of course, any time may be a good time for you and your prospects.</p>
<p>You could go the route of following the statistics. For example, findings from <a href="https://www.revenue.io/blog/the-best-time-to-cold-call-prospects-in-2020">one recent study</a> suggested that “decision makers are more likely to engage in the late afternoon,” with engagement rates peaking “during the 4-5 p.m. hour.” And data from <a href="https://www.execvision.io/blog/best-time-cold-call/">another study</a> showed that “the best time to cold call a prospect is between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., with 10 a.m. (15.53%) and 2 p.m. (15.01%) providing the best response times.”</p>
<p>Studies like those might provide a good starting point. But ultimately, you need to find what works best for you and your prospects. That’s going to require some trial and error.</p>
<p>Hypothesize about what might work best, give it a try, track your results, and repeat the process until you’ve found a time range that yields the highest results. Once you’ve identified the ideal times to call, make that a regular part of your schedule and stick to it.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">6. Demonstrate Your Value Immediately</h3>
<p>The prospect should immediately learn 1) who you are and 2) what you bring to the table. And they should know both of those things <em>before</em> they can even begin to consider objections.</p>
<p>Sharing who you are is easy – just start off the call by mentioning your name and, if applicable, the name of your business or brokerage. But how can you demonstrate your value?</p>
<ul class="BlogUL">
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Share a version of your unique value proposition</strong>, a statement that expresses how you’re different (and better!) than your competitors. (Don’t have one? <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/real-estate-marketing-plan/">Market Leader’s free real estate marketing plan</a> walks you through the process of creating a unique value proposition, vision statement, and mission statement.)</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Share your enthusiasm.</strong> Think of Theodore Roosevelt’s famous line: “Nobody cares how much you know until they know how much you care.” Demonstrating your level of expertise is very important (which is why it’s our next point), but it’s not the only thing that matters when cold calling – you also need to show that you have their best interest at heart. Your prospect is looking for an advocate and cheerleader, not just a consultant.</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Share what you know.</strong> By translating not only facts and figures but also your interpretation, insights, and conclusions based on the data, you’re essentially saying, “I’m the local expert, I’ve put in the hard work to understand this market at a granular level, and I’m bringing a kind of value that no other agent can provide.” It’s that kind of analysis that will put you leagues beyond what your prospects can find on Zillow.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="BlogH3">7. Be Memorable</h3>
<p>Not only are you competing with other agents, you’re also competing with all of the other things that take prospects’ time and attention away from buying or selling. So find your own unique way to stand out. Maybe for you it’s your personality, a catchphrase, a resource you provide, or a personal connection you share.</p>
<p>But remember: Ultimately, the call isn’t about you. It’s about helping the prospect. So as you’re capturing their attention, be careful not to push them aside. Always help your prospects draw a clear connection between what you do and how (exactly) that benefits them.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">8. Give Them the Next Steps</h3>
<p>After the call is over, they should know what’s going to happen next. End by scheduling a meeting, for example, or nailing down the best time for a follow-up call.</p>
<p>Is there a specific action you want them to take after the call? Tell them plainly. Depending on the situation, you might have one specific call to action (e.g., “Take a look at the listings on my website,” or “Check out this <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/what-is-a-cma-in-real-estate/">CMA</a> and let me know what you think”).</p>
<p>Or maybe the next step is something you will do (e.g., “I’m going to shoot you an email that walks you through the buying process…,” or “I’ll give you a call on Wednesday…”).</p>
<p>In any case, don’t end the call without providing clarity about who is doing what when.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is a CMA in real estate?</strong></p>
<p>“CMA” stands for comparative market analysis, and it refers to the process of estimating a property’s value, based on the listing prices and sold prices of similar homes nearby and other data related to the local market.</p>
<p>Many agents either don’t know how to do a CMA (because they didn’t receive any training) or they don’t realize its importance. So it ends up being just another task on their long list of obligations.</p>
<p>But it can be (should be!) much more than that. This kind of analysis is extremely valuable, especially in today’s fast-moving, ever-changing real estate market. It’s one of the most important things separating real estate agents from Zillow.</p>
<p>Get ready to learn everything you need to know about performing comparative market analyses that benefit leads, clients, and agents alike, because this article walks you through how to do a CMA in four simple steps.</p>
<p>But before we get into the nitty gritty, let’s take a step back to consider the purpose. Why is a CMA in real estate even necessary?</p>
<p>Knowing how to create a CMA from start to finish is important. But having a clear understanding of the “why” is what will give you a significant boost over your competitors.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">How a CMA Benefits <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Consumers</span></h2>
<p>The benefit of a CMA for sellers (or potential sellers) is obvious. By comparing their home to similar homes that either just sold or are under contract, <strong>they can get a better idea of what their home is currently worth</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>But a CMA can also be a valuable point of reference for <em>buyers</em>.</strong> They don’t want to make an offer that’s too low, and they don’t want to overpay. A CMA helps them avoid both risks. It helps them size up their competition (by showing them what other buyers may be willing to pay for the home they’re interested in) while also giving them a clear boundary that shows how high is too high.</p>
<p>In any case, what consumers of all kinds are looking for is objectivity. They want to know without a doubt that a home’s value is derived from a valid, data-driven process. Why? Because it <strong>provides a sense of comfort</strong> during what is often a stressful time and it <strong>gives them confidence</strong> to make a move (pun intended).</p>
<p>The upcoming four-step process for creating a CMA in real estate will offer all of the aforementioned consumer-facing benefits.</p>
<p>But a CMA also benefits you as the agent. Here’s how.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">How a CMA Benefits <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Real Estate Agents</span></h2>
<p>Let’s start with the basics.</p>
<p><strong>A CMA is a great way to prove your value and establish credibility.</strong> By showing not only facts and figures but also your interpretation, insights, and conclusions based on the data, you’re essentially saying, “I’m the local expert, I’ve put in the hard work to understand this market at a granular level, and I’m bringing a kind of value that no other agent can provide.”</p>
<p><strong>A CMA gives you the confidence you need to negotiate like a top-producer.</strong> You can rest on the power of objectivity instead of the weakness of personal opinion. It’s difficult to dismiss an offer or counter a price that’s supported with good data.</p>
<p>But did you know that a CMA can also be a powerful marketing tool?</p>
<p><strong>For example, consider sending prospects a CMA as part of your <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/real-estate-direct-mail/">direct mail marketing</a> strategy.</strong> Homeowners are rarely in touch with local market trends, despite what they might think. Few could tell you the current value of their home, and chances are, they’d be shocked to know how much the homes in their neighborhoods are currently selling for.</p>
<p>Leveraging a real estate CMA (even a lightweight CMA in a postcard, brochure-style pamphlet, or an email) can help prospects think more seriously about taking the next step. It could be that simply presenting that kind of information to a prospect – at a time when no other agent would – is all it takes to turn them into a lead, and eventually into a client.</p>
<p>By the way, <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/products/professional-for-agents/">you can easily create useful mini CMAs for your leads and clients with Market Leader Pro</a>.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">How To Do a CMA (for Sellers)</h2>
<p>First, a caveat. There’s no such thing as a one-size-fits-all process for making a CMA in real estate. The exact procedures will differ each time, depending on where you are, who it’s for, and why you’re doing it.</p>
<p>So while the four-step process outlined below is a kind of “how-to guide,” it can’t possibly take every situation into account. Too many factors and variables are involved, because all prospects, leads, clients, neighborhoods, homes, and listings are different.</p>
<p>For example, how you do a CMA for a standard ranch-style home in rural America is going to look very different than what you’d do for a inner-city luxury property in Toronto. And the process you’d go through to create a generalized direct mail piece will look different than it would if you were putting a report together for a buyer.</p>
<p>Regardless, it’s helpful to familiarize yourself with the basic methodology that this step-by-step guide outlines so you can tailor it to the needs at hand.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">The Checklist</h3>
<p>Every standard CMA in real estate (for a seller) will include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Property details (Step 1)</li>
<li>Comps (Step 2)</li>
<li>Pricing recommendations (Step 3)</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Step 1: Learn About the Home</h3>
<p>In the steps that follow, you’re going to find comparable listings (or “comps”). To do that, you first need to learn everything you can about the home so you’ll know how to draw accurate comparisons.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that you’re doing more than just fact-collecting. You’re also learning about the home’s “story,” so to speak: the history of the home, the neighborhood, and the surrounding area.</p>
<p>The more research you do here, the more accurate the CMA will be. But here are the essential pieces of information you’ll need to collect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Location</li>
<li>Size (square footage)</li>
<li>Year built</li>
<li>Number of beds and baths</li>
<li>Condition (e.g., Is it new-build? Have there been any significant renovations?)</li>
<li>Amenities, customizations, and special features</li>
<li>Property tax information</li>
</ul>
<p>You can draw from many different sources as you conduct your research, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The homeowner, of course</li>
<li>MLS data</li>
<li>Previous listing data (i.e., list price, sold price, days on the market, etc.)</li>
<li>The NAR’s <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/realtors-property-resource-rpr">Realtors Property Resource</a> (RPR)</li>
<li>Tax records</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Step 2: Compile a List of Comps</h3>
<p>Now that you know about the home, you know how to compare it to other homes in the area. Here are some best practices.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be smart about how you choose your comps.</strong> Comparables (i.e., “comps”) are listings (both sold and active) that are very similar to the property you’re working with. Get as close as you can to finding identical matches, especially in terms of their location, square footage, lot size, layout, style, and condition.</li>
<li><strong>Compile a strong list.</strong> Include enough properties on your list to determine an average and suggest a reasonable range of prices. But don’t make it so long that you and your client get bogged down with too much information.</li>
<li><strong>Stick with the here-and-now.</strong> Remember, the key to making a successful CMA in real estate is to work with accurate, reliable, and relevant data. There’s no point in comparing the home in question to a listing that sold three years ago, or even one year ago, for that matter. You and your client need to know what similar homes are selling for now. So stay current, within, say, the past three months. And in this market, you definitely shouldn’t dig back farther than six months.</li>
<li><strong>Look at sold prices and active listings.</strong> By looking at homes that have sold recently and listings that are currently active, you’ll get an even keener sense of the local market’s condition. Be sure to pay close attention to comparable listings that are currently under contract because that will give you insight into the difference between asking price and sold price. It’s those kinds of nuances that will both impress your clients and give you the competitive edge you need to become the local expert.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Step 3: Set Your Pricing Recommendations</h3>
<p>At this point you’ll be equipped with all of the information you need to provide sound guidance for your clients.</p>
<p>Give them a range of three numbers to consider – one that’s on the conservative side, one that’s on the aggressive side, and one that’s in the middle.</p>
<p>Base your pricing recommendations on three factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your list of comps</li>
<li>The home’s condition and appeal (including any adjustments that need to be made to account for customizations, amenities, renovations, etc.)</li>
<li>Anticipation of where the market seems to be headed</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Step 4: Create and Deliver Your CMA</h3>
<p>There are many formatting options and ways you could present your CMA report to your clients. For you, that might look like a PowerPoint presentation, a simple set of tables and charts, or even a quick email with a bulleted outline.</p>
<p>There’s no right or wrong here. But as we saw in the checklist above, be sure to include at least a summary of the property details, your list of comps, and your pricing recommendations. Make it easy for them to understand your process and how you arrived at your conclusions. Not only does this show the objectivity of your report, but it also puts your leads and clients at ease in case they’re disappointed by numbers they didn’t expect.</p>
<p>However you go about delivering and presenting your CMA, keep in mind that you’re bringing value, proving your worth, and demonstrating your expertise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pictures can say a thousand words, but they can’t say everything. At some point, the power of language has to take over.</p>
<p><strong>The best real estate listing description examples you can find will all have one thing in common: they’ll all have compelling marketing copy that was crafted to <em>sell</em>, not just describe.</strong></p>
<p>If you’ve been overlooking the sales power of copy in your listing descriptions, welcome. You’re not the only one. Mediocre (if not flat out poor) descriptions are the norm. And that’s unfortunate. Because listing descriptions are extremely important.</p>
<p>Consumers are now more likely to search online for a home than ever before. According to a recent report from <a href="https://cdn.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/2022-home-buyers-and-sellers-generational-trends-03-23-2022.pdf">NAR</a>, “Among all generations of home buyers, the first step taken in the home search process was to look online for properties.”</p>
<p>Half of all buyers they surveyed (51%) said they found the home they purchased online. (Which is almost double the amount of those who said they found their home through their agent, by the way.)</p>
<p><strong>The point is, real estate listing descriptions matter. They may even matter a lot, especially if they’re done well.</strong></p>
<p>And the best part is, it’s not as if you have to spend a ton of time mastering the art and science of copywriting. All it takes to boost the selling power of your listing descriptions is a bit of know-how and some practice.</p>
<p>This article will walk you through exactly how to write descriptions that sell (and how not to write them). Then we’ll take a look at four real estate listing description examples from top-notch agents so you can see how it’s done.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">How To Write a Real Estate Listing Description</h2>
<p>Here are some best practices to keep in mind as you supercharge your listings with compelling marketing copy.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Start With the Seller</h3>
<p>As the agent, you can put pieces together and come up with some ideas about what you should highlight in the description. But the seller has a unique perspective on the home, and they know better than you do what it’s like to live there day to day. They’ll almost certainly raise excellent selling points that never would have occurred to you unless you had asked.</p>
<p>Find out what it was that originally caught their attention when they bought. What do they love about it? What will they miss when they sell?</p>
<p>Their favorite things about the home are likely to be the same things that will attract potential buyers. So before you work your marketing magic, get inspiration straight from the sellers themselves.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Write to Your Audience</h3>
<p>In other words, don’t write listing descriptions that only sound good to you and your client. Let it all revolve around potential buyers (and their agent).</p>
<p>Listing agents are, above all else, marketers. And marketers always determine a target buyer for their products before coming up with a plan.</p>
<p>We don’t see urban streetwear companies appealing to Gen X or Baby Boomers. Millennials aren’t likely to get targeted online ads from AARP. Yet the average listing description is a lot like the average real estate agent – trying to be all things to all people. That has never worked before, and it won’t work for you.</p>
<p>So before you write a word, put yourself in your prospects’ shoes. What will they want to hear? What are the kinds of things they’ll be looking for? Write their dream home into your copy.</p>
<p>What objections or fears might they have? Cut them off at the pass and address concerns head-on. Do they think it’s unaffordable? Talk about how easy financing can be.</p>
<p>Is it a family home with a large backyard and schools nearby? Speak directly to the parents. Is it a swanky uptown condo that looks like a status symbol? Speak to that millionaire entrepreneur looking for a home that doubles as an accessory.</p>
<p>Your listing descriptions need a personal flair that cater to the home buyers you’re trying to reach. Play into their vision, and make it clear that your listing is exactly what they’re looking for.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Craft a Killer Headline</h3>
<p>The amazing listing description you labored to create is worthless if no one reads it. And the best way to get potential buyers to read your description is to write a headline they can’t ignore, a headline that captures their attention and sets the tone for the entire listing.</p>
<p>The main purpose of the headline is to get them to read the first line of your description. And the main purpose of that first line is to get them to read your second line, and on and on it goes.</p>
<p>If you spent as much time crafting the headline as you did writing the description, it would be time well spent.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Think Like a Copywriter</h3>
<p>When you’re writing real estate listing descriptions, you’re writing to sell. At its core, what you’re doing here is no different than what legendary advertising experts like <a href="https://www.oneclub.org/hall-of-fame/-bio/david-ogilvy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">David Ogilvy</a> did for decades.</p>
<p>So don’t approach this task as a real estate agent filling in the blank on a form that says “Description”. Approach it as if you were Mad Men’s Don Draper penning irresistible marketing copy that turns heads and closes deals.</p>
<p>To make your “adman” impersonation believable, here are some quick-and-dirty tips for writing like a copywriter.</p>
<ul class="BlogUL">
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Lead with the benefits.</strong> Then move to the features. In other words, talk first about how the home will benefit the buyer, what problems it may solve for them, and why all of that matters. Then get into the specs and nitty-gritty details.</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Write like a human.</strong> Studies have proven over and over that simple, person-to-person writing is most effective. So say what you mean and keep it conversational. Read it out loud to test yourself – if it sounds like normal human speech, you’re on the right track!</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Be concise.</strong> Less is (often) more when it comes to writing marketing copy. Use powerful words that pack a punch instead of frivolous adverbs.</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Create a sense of urgency.</strong> Buyers know homes don’t stay on the market for long. Give them that extra nudge they need to take action now by <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/create-sense-of-urgency-in-prospect-roleplay">creating a sense of urgency</a>.</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>“Show, don’t tell.”</strong> Guide their daydreaming and create mental images. Why list the dimensions of the kitchen when you could say, “You can cook for 2 or 20 in this spacious, guest-friendly kitchen.” Instead of stating flatly that the ceilings are made of plaster, mention that they could “entertain beneath soaring Venetian plaster ceilings.”</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Don’t Do This When You Write Listing Descriptions</h2>
<p>Now you know how to write real estate listing descriptions. But here’s what not to do.</p>
<ul class="BlogUL">
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Don’t overthink it.</strong> Yes, your listing descriptions are important. But the stakes aren’t so high that you need to spend hours and hours crafting a perfect piece. Why? First, because it’ll take you way too long to write. And also because your writing will show that you overthought it, which will make it less effective.</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Don’t use clever or flowery language.</strong> Write plainly. This isn’t a novel. The words themselves shouldn’t steal the spotlight. Yes, think creatively, but don’t distract the prospect with pretty prose. It’s counterproductive and misses the point completely.</li>
<li class="BlogLI"><strong>Don’t repeat information.</strong> Space is valuable. Don’t waste it by repeating all of the details that show up in the listing details. Describe the property in a way that doesn’t tell them what they already know (e.g., lot size, year built, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>There are more blunders to avoid. <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/5-cringe-worthy-mistakes-experienced-agents-make-on-their-listings/">Learn about the five cringe-worthy mistakes experienced agents make on their listings.</a></p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">4 Creative Real Estate Listing Description Examples</h2>
<p>Glean wisdom from these four noteworthy listing description examples from expert real estate agents and let the inspiration begin.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">1. Evoke Settings &amp; Scenes</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-61763 " src="https://www.marketleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Cathedral.png" alt="Real estate listing description example #1" width="443" height="760" /></p>
<p>This first listing description example does a great job of using language to create mental images. For example, we imagine waking up in the loft suite, hosting a big party out on the deck, and huddling around the fire pit. Framing your listing descriptions in this way gets your prospects to “read between the lines” and see in their mind’s eye more than what appears in the copy. (Plus, this listing gets extra credit for ending with that perfect call to action!)</p>
<p>Well done, <a href="https://www.eastsidepropertysearch.com/listing/mlsid/185/propertyid/1997697/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aubie Pouncey</a>!</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">2. Pile Up All the Perks</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-61764" src="https://www.marketleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lynnwood.png" alt="Real estate listing description example #2" width="443" height="763" /></p>
<p>Notice how this listing description example heaps on the goodness. Just when you think it couldn’t get any better, it does. We learn immediately that it’s “better than new” in that fantastic opening line. As we read on, we hear about upgrade after upgrade, with the excitement-building repetition of the word “new”. By the end, it sets the prospect up to feel like the decision to make a move on this house is a no-brainer. Numerous renovations, great floor plan, “dramatic two story entry,” private yard, fantastic location… What more could you want!?</p>
<p>Thanks for showing us how it’s done, <a href="https://www.elizabethavery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elizabeth Avery</a>!</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">3. Show Authentic Enthusiasm</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-61765" src="https://www.marketleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bramble.png" alt="Real estate listing description example #3" width="443" height="761" /></p>
<p>The excitement is palpable. And yet, it doesn’t come across as contrived or cheesy. This home’s apparent uniqueness speaks for itself, and the copy in this third listing description example does a great job of emphasizing that fact. It leaves the reader feeling as if they just have to see it to believe it. It’s hard not to feel joyful when you read things like, “this home is nothing short of AMAZING,” and, “This location is one you just can’t recreate!” And as a side note, who doesn’t want to work with an agent with that kind of contagious energy!?</p>
<p>We can feel your beachside happiness all the way from here, <a href="https://www.peggyrowerealty.com/listing/mlsid/297/propertyid/900674/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peggy Rowe</a>!</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">4. Speak to the Heart of Your Audience With Laser-like Focus</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-61766 aligncenter" src="https://www.marketleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Scottsdale.png" alt="Real estate listing descriptions example #4" width="443" height="735" /></p>
<p>This final home listing description example demonstrates why it’s so important to understand your audience. If you have a thorough understanding of who your potential buyers are, what they care about, and what their pain points are, you’ll know exactly how to capture their hearts with your listing description. This example has a very clear target (buyers interested in downsizing; buyers who have prioritized convenience and simplicity; buyers looking for a vacation home, seasonal home, or a home they can feel comfortable leaving behind when they travel). And the entire listing description is centered on meeting their needs and addressing their concerns.</p>
<p>Thank you, <a href="https://www.pollyblackwell.com/listing/mlsid/8/propertyid/6477055/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polly Blackwell</a>! You nailed it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To put the bottom line at the top, referral commission for real estate agents is approximately 25% of the gross commission from the applicable side of the transaction.</p>
<p>Why “approximately”? Because there isn’t a standard rate for referral fees (and therefore referral commissions), and they’re negotiable.</p>
<p>You likely have many more questions related to referral fees in real estate. If so, you’re not alone. It can be a complicated topic.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at some of the most frequently asked questions about agent-to-agent referrals.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Why Would I Ever Send Business to Someone Else?</h2>
<p>It’s a fair question. If nothing else, the concept of giving a referral might seem somewhat counterproductive at first. But there are certainly times when a referral is the best option. Here are the most common reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The obvious one first: <strong>You can get a significant portion of the paycheck for doing a small portion of the work</strong>. Of course, you’d probably rather do all of the work and cash in on all of the commission. But there are a few reasons why that may not be possible, which would mean collecting a referral fee is your best option. Here are two examples…</li>
<li><strong>It’s an out-of-market transaction.</strong> Let’s say, for example, a client of yours is looking to buy a home in another state, a state in which you aren’t licensed. You can’t be the one to complete the sale, but you can refer your client to another agent and receive a referral commission on that transaction. Many businesses, like <a href="https://www.referralexchange.com/">ReferralExchange.com</a>, can help you find out-of-state agents to make referrals to.</li>
<li><strong>You’re not qualified to help.</strong> It’s good to have a wide range of expertise. But not every real estate agent is qualified to handle every type of transaction. Sometimes you’re just not a good fit for the job. For example, a residential real estate agent may not be able to work with commercial properties. Rather than stumbling beyond your purview, sometimes it’s best to hand it off to an agent who can provide the help your client needs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="BlogH2">What Is a Fair Real Estate Referral Commission?</h2>
<p>There are two pitfalls to avoid: asking too much and asking too little. If your referral fee is too high, you jeopardize the relationship you have with the other real estate agent. And that could come back to haunt you later when the tables are turned and they choose to refer business to someone else.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if your referral fee is too low, you might be forfeiting the portion of the commission that’s rightfully yours.</p>
<p>So where’s the middle ground?</p>
<p>A good rule of thumb is to stick close to the standard referral fee for real estate agents, which is about <a href="https://www.referralexchange.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ReferralExchange-Report_2017.pdf">25%</a>. Some agents go as high as 50% and some go as low as 20%.</p>
<p>Where you set the rate for your referral fee is completely up to you. As long as you avoid both pitfalls, keep your network happy, and stay open to negotiation, you’ll be on the right track.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Why Should I Seek To Get More Referrals From Agents?</h2>
<p>First, because referral commission in real estate can be lucrative.</p>
<p>How lucrative? It’s difficult to say. But using an example to break down some rough estimates will give you a good idea.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSPUS">current median home sale price</a> in the U.S. is reportedly around $440,300.</li>
<li>Let’s say the total commission (for one side of the transaction) is 5%. Using $440,300 as our example, that would amount to $22,015.</li>
<li>If the commission fee is 25% of $22,015, the referral agent would receive $5,503.75 (before taxes and fees, of course). Not bad for just a moment’s worth of work!</li>
</ul>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/blogs/economists-outlook/sources-of-income-for-real-estate-agents">a recent study from the National Association of Realtors</a> (NAR), the typical Realtor receives approximately one quarter of their income from real estate referral commission (both from consumers and other agents).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.referralexchange.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ReferralExchange-Report_2017.pdf">Another study</a> indicated that outbound referrals “make up a median of 12.5% of total transactions per agent per year.” And if the commission fees are around 25%, that can really add up to a significant amount of income for all agents involved.</p>
<p>Combining data points like these (<a href="https://listwithclever.com/real-estate-blog/realtor-referral-how-do-referral-agents-work-and-get-paid/">and others</a>), it’s not hard to see why agents often lean toward a favorable view of the income-generating power of referral commission.</p>
<p>And another reason to pursue more referrals is because one referral often leads to many more, which can eventually become <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/products/real-estate-leads/">a steady (and passive!) lead generation source</a>. If that piques your interest, be sure to learn <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/5-ways-to-build-a-referral-based-business/">these five ways to build a referral-based business</a>.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Is It Possible To Miss Out on Real Estate Referral Commission?</h2>
<p>Okay fine, this is not a frequently asked question. But maybe it should be. Because the answer is yes. There are two ways to mess up referrals.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Don’t Put It in Writing</h3>
<p>Real estate referral commission deals can get messy for all parties involved without a contract. Not only could it jeopardize the relationship you have with the client and the other agent and brokerage, but the transaction could even be illegal.</p>
<p>Whether you’re giving or receiving referral commission, be sure you have a real estate referral contract written up that documents everything about the transaction. Check out this <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/applications-and-forms/2013/REALTOR-REFERRAL-FORM-F-2013-11-18.pdf">referral contract</a> from the NAR, for example.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Ignore the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA)</h3>
<p>If you’re an agent working in the U.S., you’ll need to abide by the statutes outlined in the RESPA, a law Congress passed in 1974 to protect consumers. It ensures that consumers are always aware of the costs associated with their lone, and it helps to prevent costs from rising for unethical and unnecessary reasons.</p>
<p>Among other provisions, <a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_respa_frequently_asked_questions.pdf">RESPA</a> “prohibits certain actions related to federally related mortgage loans,” including kickbacks and “unearned fee arrangements.”</p>
<p>To summarize the legalese, it means no portion of any real estate referral fees involved in a transaction can make their way to a third party or any person or entity that isn’t a licensed agent. For example, agents can’t abuse the right to add the cost of referral fees to a consumer’s loan so they can pay off insurance companies, appraisers, construction companies, home inspectors, or attorneys for more business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Generating more listing leads can be extremely difficult. But it’s never impossible. Unless of course… you have a flawed plan. Or worse, no plan at all.</p>
<p>You may have heard the often-quoted (and apparently anonymous) adage that goes something like this:</p>
<p>“Every system is perfectly designed to give you the results you’re getting.”</p>
<p>We hear it often because it’s true. So if you’ve hit a point in your career where you&#8217;re only getting buyer leads, it may simply be a matter of refining your lead generation system and your plan for growth. We’re about to do just that.</p>
<p>To help you eliminate the guesswork involved in getting more listing leads, we’ve boiled it all down to seven essential tactics:</p>
<ol class="BlogOL">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol class="BlogOL">
<li class="BlogLI">Build Your Brand</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Nail Your Marketing</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Work Your Network</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Warm Up to Cold Calling</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Attend Events &amp; Host Your Own</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Find Your New Friends</li>
<li class="BlogLI">Buy Real Estate Leads</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s start with the foundation.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Build Your Brand</h2>
<p>Put simply, <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/real-estate-agents-need-a-brand/">your brand</a> is what other people think of you and your real estate business. You have many competitors in this field, and branding is your differentiator. Everything you do to attract clients should fit into a compelling and cohesive brand experience.</p>
<p>Want to <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/improve-your-branding-to-attract-better-clients/">improve your real estate branding</a> so you can generate more listing leads? Start by answering these three essential questions:</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">What Is Your Unique Value Proposition?</h3>
<p>A unique value proposition (UVP) is a statement that informs prospective clients about what sets you apart from the other agents in your market. Think of it as an elevator pitch, but in writing. It’s what shows you’re not a dime-a-dozen agent.</p>
<p>Your UVP should be concise. It should be punchy so that it’s as memorable and clear as possible. Most UVPs are only a sentence or two in length.</p>
<p>Use numbers whenever possible. Stats and figures give prospects something to hold on to. Plus, they go a long way in boosting perceived credibility.</p>
<p>Does your value proposition speak directly to sellers? For example:</p>
<p>“I have helped more clients sell their Seattle homes in the last five years than any other agent. My client’s homes sell in an average of just 20 days, 25 percent faster than the average for my area.”</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">What is Your Mission Statement</h3>
<p>Your mission statement takes your UVP and turns it into an action that’s tied to a greater purpose. It explains what you do, who you serve, how you’re different, and why you do what you do.</p>
<p>A well-crafted mission statement serves two very important functions. First, it keeps you focused on your priorities, your overarching purpose, and the meaningfulness of your work. And second, it tells your prospects and clients exactly what they can expect when they work with you.</p>
<p>A mission statement does not need to be comprehensive, overly specific and detailed, or even a complete sentence.</p>
<p>To get the creative juices flowing, consider these two examples:</p>
<p><a href="https://news.remax.com/our-mission-to-be-the-worldwide-real-estate-leader/">RE/MAX:</a> “To be the worldwide real estate leader, achieving our goals by helping others achieve theirs. Everybody wins.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/company">Atlassian:</a> “From medicine and space travel, to disaster response and pizza deliveries, our products help teams all over the planet advance humanity through the power of software. Our mission is to help unleash the potential of every team.”</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Who Is Your Target Market</h3>
<p>You can’t be everything to everyone. If you try, your brand will end up blending in instead of standing out. So take the time to identify a focused target audience.</p>
<p>Try to be as specific as possible. To narrow down even farther, consider creating profiles (or “<a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-research">personas</a>”) based on your top two or three ideal clients.</p>
<p>Let data be your guide. For example, if you’re interested in a particular neighborhood, get all of the information you can find about the demographics in that area. Learn about who follows you on social media. <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/solutions/customizable-websites/">Get a customizable website with MLS listings</a> which attracts buyers and sellers and – crucially – collects and analyzes data about visitors’ activities.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Nail Your Marketing</h2>
<p>Now that you’ve considered the essential brand identity questions for your business, you’re ready to move on to the second step: adjusting your marketing strategy to attract more listing leads.</p>
<p>Yes, you can buy <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/products/real-estate-leads/">online real estate leads</a>. But you also need to incorporate that lead generation strategy into a solid marketing plan that includes tried-and-true best practices as well as the newest cutting-edge ideas.</p>
<p>To provide the briefest of checklists, here are three marketing strategy must-haves.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">A Social Media Strategy Designed To Get More Listing Leads</h3>
<p>Don’t underestimate the power of having a strong digital presence through social media. It may be among the simplest and most effective ways to generate leads.</p>
<p>Of course, if you’re looking for more listing leads, be sure to post content that’s especially relevant for potential sellers in your area. Provide useful tips, helpful advice, and insightful statistics that demonstrate credibility and trustworthiness. With each impression, you’re increasing the likelihood that you’ll be top-of-mind when they’re ready to sell.</p>
<p>If you haven’t already, take 15 minutes to <a href="https://fitsmallbusiness.com/real-estate-facebook-page/">create a Facebook page for your business</a> that’s tailored specifically to accommodate potential home sellers. Always remember to keep your professional profiles public so they’re discoverable by the networks of people you are connected to.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Advertising Investment</h3>
<p>First, define which advertising channels you’ll use to promote your business. Then determine your budget for each channel. Sometimes it’s easiest to decide what you can afford on a monthly basis at first, and as you identify what performs best, you can map out your annual budget.</p>
<p>Ad placement is crucial. Rather than placing ads where all of the other listing agents are and hoping for the best, think specifically about the home sellers in your target market and where they spend their time – both online and in person. Do your research and allow the findings to help you determine the best place to advertise.</p>
<p>Important: In addition to the monetary cost of advertising dollars, think of the time cost involved with setting up and managing your campaigns. Should you be the one creating your seller lead generation campaigns, or an advertising expert who will be more effective and efficient?</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Marketing Automation Tools</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/real-estate-marketing-automation/">best real estate marketing automation tools</a> do it all. With <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/products/professional-for-agents/">Market Leader Professional</a>, for example, you get a customizable website, a fully-integrated CRM, and the ability to automate campaigns, newsletters, and content pieces like postcards, flyers, and video-enabled mobile-responsive emails which will help you stay top-of-mind with your contact database so they think of you when it’s time to sell.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Work Your Network</h2>
<p>If marketing is primarily about trying to reach prospects “out there,” networking is primarily about connecting with the many listing leads you’ll find “right here” in your social spheres. You’ve built your brand. You’ve developed a marketing strategy. And now it’s time to work your network.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Let Friends and Family Know You’re a Real Estate Agent</h3>
<p>It’s simple. It’s basic. And we mention it here because it’s an essential part of every lead generation strategy. Personal connection often trumps any other kind of connection.</p>
<p>And chances are, someone who is part of your family or friend group is currently thinking about selling their home. If not, they probably know someone who is. Make sure it’s your name that’s fresh on their mind.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Tap Into to the Wider Social Circle</h3>
<p>What organizations, teams, and communities are you a part of? What about friends of friends? Are you part of any groups on social media?</p>
<p>Most people belong to a bunch of networks without even realizing it. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Church groups</li>
<li>Clubs, like Rotary, rec sports teams, and alumni organizations</li>
<li>Online group like Nextdoor communities and neighborhood Facebook pages</li>
</ul>
<p>This wider social circle is full of high-quality prospects and excellent referral sources. All of whom are more likely to choose you over a stranger without a shared interest.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Warm Up to Cold Calling</h2>
<p>Some real estate agents dislike cold calling because it’s frustrating. Others feel anxious just reading about it. The truth is, it’s often both frustrating and frightening.</p>
<p>Some argue that it’s one of the most important ways to generate listing leads. Others argue that it’s a waste of time. Again – both are true.</p>
<p>Like it or not, cold calling is still an effective way to get more real estate seller leads. The key is to understand who to target and how to talk to them. Here are two groups to target as part of the fourth step in getting more listing leads.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Call FSBOs—“For Sale by Owner” Real Estate Listings)</h3>
<p>Even though they might be resistant to the idea at first, many DIY home sellers can be persuaded to work with you instead when they realize how much you can help.</p>
<p>Find FSBO listings on sites like Craigslist, ForSaleByOwner.com, and Zillow. Then give them a call, using <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/best-fsbo-scripts/">the best FSBO script you can find</a> to increase the persuasion factor.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Call Expired Listings</h3>
<p>A step-by-step guide for getting more listing leads would be incomplete if it didn’t include a tip about expired listings. These would-be-sellers are often in a tough spot.</p>
<p>They had hopes and dreams of selling but couldn’t. And now they’ve either given up or they’re unsure about how to move forward. You can be the agent who sweeps in to restore their confidence. Be sure to use <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/expired-listing-scripts/">the best expired listing scripts</a> for each situation.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Attend Events &amp; Host Your Own</h2>
<p>Top-performing listing agents are always connected to a wide network. They’re always on the lookout for new ways to develop relationships.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to do that is to attend in-person events and to host your own. Here are the top three ways to expand your reach so you can get more listing leads.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Attend Networking Events</h3>
<p>There are many different kinds of events that are meant to help you establish a stronger network. But if you want more seller clients, look for meetups, community events, and smaller conferences that will put you in contact specifically with sellers from your target market.</p>
<p>Struggling to find any events that are a good fit for you? Host your own!</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Host a Community Event</h3>
<p>Rather than going to meet prospects, have them come to you. It can be related to real estate, but it doesn’t have to be. Have fun and get creative with it.</p>
<p>Host a party, charity dinner, concert, local business giveaway event… the options are endless. It could be small or large, simple or extravagant.</p>
<p>As long as you’re reaching out to potential home sellers in your area and getting a chance to mingle, you’re on the right track.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Host Open Houses</h3>
<p>Another great way to attract home seller leads is to host open houses. Captivating ones, not boring ones.</p>
<p>Think of them as another kind of networking opportunity or community event. Make it the kind of event which potential listing leads in your area would actually want to attend, then show them what they can expect if they work with you to sell their home.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Find Your New Friends</h2>
<p>You could be the kind of lone-wolf real estate agent who shoulders everything on their own. There may be advantages to that. But it also comes at a great cost.</p>
<p>You need help from a circle of friends: go-to contractors, photographers, movers, video editors, and other professionals from real estate-related fields.</p>
<p>Working without them can prevent you from forming strong connections with your clients, building new relationships, generating listing leads, and managing your day-to-day tasks. And that might mean you have to turn away business because you simply can’t find enough hours in the day.</p>
<p>But you don’t have to go that route. Instead, consider forming a team around you of experts who can offer support where you need it most. Not only can they shoulder the weight by providing the expertise you need, but they can also expand your reach and multiply your marketing efforts. Here are two ways to find your new circle of friends.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Partner With Contractors, Home Stagers, Photographers, and Videographers</h3>
<p>The benefit of having a go-to network like this is twofold. It sets you up to provide help for your sellers when they need these kinds of services. And at the same time, it widens your network and increases the number of potential referral sources you have.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Start a Team of Listing Agents (Or Join One)</h3>
<p>Real estate agents are choosing to team up with other agents now more than ever before. There are four main reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>A team structure provides accountability.</strong> Members keep each other on track and motivate, celebrate, and encourage each other along the way. All of that goes far beyond the warm-and-fuzzies. It leads to greater levels of productivity.</li>
<li><strong>Teams often have a larger and more reliable stream of leads.</strong> They can combine their lead generation, marketing efforts, and social networks to create a business that’s greater than the sum of its parts.</li>
<li><strong>Working as a team presents an opportunity for each agent to specialize and focus on what he or she does best.</strong> The best teams work as a complementary whole – where one agent is weak, the other is strong, and vice versa.</li>
<li><strong>There are now more tools than ever before</strong> that make it possible for teams to work together and crush their gross commission income goals. With <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/products/pro-for-teams/">Market Leader’s Pro for Teams</a>, for example, real estate teams can recruit and retain agents, increase productivity with top-notch marketing automation, and create a seamless brand experience. All with one platform.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Buy Real Estate Leads</h2>
<p>In real estate, even the best business plans have to account for elements of unpredictability. There are always going to be factors that are out of your control. But getting a steady stream of exclusive online listing leads doesn’t have to be one of them.</p>
<p>Market Leader offers two real estate leads products to help you grow your business. One flat monthly rate buys you a guaranteed number of exclusive buyer and seller leads in your desired areas every month.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the long-standing discussion about whether agents should give real estate closing gifts to their clients. Of course, we won’t settle the matter here. But reaching a universal conclusion that works for every agent everywhere for all time isn’t really the point anyway.</p>
<p>The question behind the question is (or at least should be): What’s the best way an agent can build a strong relationship with their clients after a closing, and does gift-giving have anything to do with that?</p>
<p>Ultimately, only you can decide what’s best for your business and your clients.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the objections.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">The 2 Main Arguments Against Giving Real Estate Closing Gifts</h2>
<h3 class="BlogH3">What’s the Point?</h3>
<p>In other words, a real estate closing gift serves no purpose. Or so the argument goes.Not only will you discover the only good reason to give real estate closing gifts, you’ll also learn how to do it. Plus, you’ll get 8 closing gift ideas!</p>
<p>Why should an agent give their clients a gift after closing? Is it to keep up with expectations? To give just because every other agent gives? To keep you at the top of your clients’ minds?</p>
<p>Those are valid reasons to give. But this first objection calls all of those reasons into question and gets us wondering if it “works,” if gift-giving is really worth it. If not, what’s the point?</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">It Isn’t Necessary.</h3>
<p>The whole concept of a service provider giving a gift to the beneficiary after a job well done is unique to real estate. It’s not a common practice in any other industry.</p>
<p>For example, doctors, hairdressers, accountants, plumbers, lawyers – none of them give gifts to their clients after they provide their services. Perhaps because the service is the gift.</p>
<p>Besides, aren’t real estate closings simply another business transaction? You made the sale. In exchange for your services, you got paid a percentage of the sales price of the home. All parties are satisfied with the outcome. The end.</p>
<p>If we follow this logic, it leads us to see a closing gift as just that: a gift. And by definition, that means it’s unwarranted, a bonus, an extra. It might be a nice gesture or even useful for retention purposes, but it’s not necessary.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">The Best (&amp; Only) Reason To Give Real Estate Closing Gifts</h2>
<p>Yes, gifts show appreciation. And sure, gifting a client may feel like the “right thing to do.” But let’s be honest. It may not always be purely altruistic. There may be ulterior motives involved in closing gifts from Realtors.</p>
<p>There’s nothing bad or wrong with that. It’s perfectly okay to admit you’re hoping to remain top-of-mind with the client or that you’re dreaming of future referrals.</p>
<p>The point here is simply to notice (and be honest about) the purpose your closing gifts serve so you can be more intentional about the gifts you choose.</p>
<p>As you know, creating and nurturing strong, long-lasting relationships with your clients is essential for success in real estate. It’s <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/the-lost-art-of-lead-conversion/">how you capture and convert leads</a>. It’s why <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/solutions/crm/">you get the most robust CRM</a>. And it’s the best reason to give real estate closing gifts.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">How To Give Real Estate Closing Gifts</h2>
<p>If you’ve decided that giving closing gifts is a good idea for your business and your clients, keep in mind that the “how” matters as much as the “what.” Here are some helpful tips.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Choose the Best Time</h3>
<p>Shortly after closing you’re already top-of-mind with the client. Your name will come up in conversations with anyone who asks about your clients’ experience buying or selling their homes.</p>
<p>If you’ve provided sterling customer service, expect your clients to rave about you. If you haven’t, no closing gift short of a Lamborghini will change that client’s opinion of you.</p>
<p>So, you may want to consider waiting a good chunk of time before offering a closing gift – even six months to a year. Aim to land a gift at their doorstep right around the time you’re fading from memory. Call it an “anniversary gift,” and include a note with it that wishes them a happy anniversary on the sale or purchase of the home.</p>
<p>You could say something like, “I saw this while out shopping and it made me think of you – I just had to buy it. Enjoy!” Then, tell them how grateful you are that they placed their trust in you and to pass your name along to anyone they know who’s thinking of buying or selling.</p>
<p>It’s a gift for them, and it’s a gift for you: You just bought yourself another couple months in that client’s memory.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Don’t Use Marketing Collateral as Your Gift</h3>
<p>The odds are high that your client can tell the difference between a genuine gift and tacky marketing tchotchke. A gift like that could have a negative effect on the way they remember you next time someone asks whether they know any good real estate agents.</p>
<p>Some agents give an item that’s branded because it technically becomes a marketing tool, which means closing gifts from Realtors are not subject to the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/publications/p463">IRS gift restrictions</a> clause. That’s fine.</p>
<p>But be careful not to give gifts that feel like marketing collateral. You don’t want to work against the altruistic, personal-touch feeling you’re trying so hard to create.</p>
<p>And what do most people do with those kinds of gifts from real estate agents? That’s right: they’ll end up in the attic if not thrown in the trash. Your best hope is that it will show up in a thrift store where someone, anyone, will actually see it.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Make It Personal</h3>
<p>Keep each individual client in mind as you’re considering the kind of gift you want to give them. Thoughtless gifts are less likely to serve the purpose you have in mind (i.e., developing a great relationship with them).</p>
<p>For example, consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What are their likes and dislikes?</strong> A gift that’s specifically tailored to their hobbies and interests is a great way to stand out. But again, the opposite is also true – a generic gift that has nothing to do with who they are could send you to the background.</li>
<li><strong>What kinds of food and drink ideas would work?</strong> Be cognizant of food allergies. A box of chocolates will be appreciated by some, but to diabetics and dieters, it’s not going to leave the best impression. The same holds true for alcohol. If you don’t know whether or not your client is carrying a sobriety coin in his pocket, forgo that bottle of premium vodka or vintage wine.</li>
<li><strong>What is home life like for them?</strong> The best closing gift for an elderly retiree might be very different than it would be for a young married couple with a newborn. What you give to a large family with three dogs and a cat may need to be different from what you give to a single college-aged first-time homebuyer.</li>
<li><strong>What will they actually use?</strong> Thinking practically can give you some great ideas. The clear advantage to giving them something they can use over and over again is that it’s more likely to keep you top of mind for long time.</li>
</ul>
<p>You get the idea. Choose a gift that will show them they’re not just another nameless paying customer.</p>
<p>Need some inspiration to get you started? Here’s a fail-proof list of both classic and unique real estate agent closing gift ideas.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">8 Thoughtful Real Estate Closing Gift Ideas</h2>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Homeowner Journal</h3>
<p>Rachael Hite at <a href="https://www.inman.com/2015/12/16/how-to-make-a-stellar-closing-gift-out-of-a-homeowner-resource/">Inman</a> does an admirable job of describing the “Black and Decker Home Planner and Logbook” and why it makes a great closing gift. (There’s even a spot for your brand logo.)</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Monthly Subscriptions</h3>
<p>It’s the closing gift that keeps on giving, month after month. And, it’s not just magazine subscriptions that agents are gifting. We’ve seen everything from monthly maid, gardening, or pool service to subscription surprise boxes for the <a href="https://bodibox.com.au/">yoga devotee</a>, <a href="https://jackedpack.com/">fitness freak</a> and even the <a href="https://www.barkbox.com/">dog owner</a>. While they can be pricey, <a href="https://urbantastebud.com/best-full-meal-subscription-boxes/">meal subscriptions</a> are popular and a blessing to your client who is too busy to cook.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Cleaning/Organizing Services</h3>
<p>This is a great idea because it’s really two gifts in one. First, because everyone loves to have a clean house. And second, because it saves your client the time it takes to clean, which frees them up to enjoy a weekend out or to just relax. Companies like <a href="https://www.mollymaid.com/gift-certificates/">Molly Maid</a> and <a href="https://www.tidy.com/gifts">TIDY</a>, for example, offer gift cards.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Flowers and Houseplants</h3>
<p>This is a classic choice. Flowers and plants make for beautiful decoration, they’re memorable, and depending on what you get, they can last a very long time.</p>
<p>You almost can’t go wrong. Almost. Make sure you choose a plant that isn’t toxic, especially if they have small children or pets.</p>
<p>You can find a list of poisonous plants, both indoor and outdoor, at <a href="https://www.poison.org/articles/plant">Poison.org</a> and <a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/animal-poison-control/toxic-and-non-toxic-plants">ASPCA.org</a>. And if you’re looking for ideas, Jayme Kinsey at <a href="https://dengarden.com/gardening/Non-Toxic-House-Plants-For-Homes-Children-Cats-and-Dogs">DenGarden.com</a> offers a list of non-toxic choices for kids, dogs and cats.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Emergency Kit</h3>
<p>While a home emergency kit might be a no-brainer, how about one for your commuter clients’ car? One for the pets of a dog-loving homeowner?</p>
<p>You can get premade kits, or to add a personal touch, they’re also a fun DIY project. Get ideas and tips from the <a href="https://www.redcross.org/store/preparedness">American Red Cross</a>.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Gift Cards</h3>
<p>Your clients will always have a wish list of things they want to buy for their new home, and you can be the agent who helps make a wish or two come true. If you’re not sure which store is their favorite, go for the failsafe big-box stores like Home Depot or Ikea.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Season Passes</h3>
<p>A season pass to a popular local venue is another great idea, especially if your client is new in town. The local water park, movie theater, children’s museum, or ski lifts, for example, are sure to be a big hit.</p>
<h3 class="BlogH3">Gadget Gifts &amp; Techie Tools</h3>
<p>Help your clients keep their house clean with a <a href="https://www.irobot.com/en_US/roomba.html">Roomba robot vacuum cleaner</a>. Gift them with peace of mind – give them <a href="https://ring.com/products/video-doorbell-v2">Ring’s video doorbell</a> or a <a href="https://august.com/">“smart lock” from August</a>. Or help them save energy and keep utilities costs down with <a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/nest_learning_thermostat_3rd_gen?hl=en-US&amp;GoogleNest&amp;pli=1">Google’s Nest Learning Thermostat</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When was the last time you took some time off? Since most real estate agents rarely take vacation time, you probably can’t remember.</p>
<p>If you’re feeling chained to your client list and think it’s impossible for you to take a vacation, think again. The world—and your business—won’t fall apart if you take some time for yourself. Your mind and body will, however, if you don’t.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Why Real Estate Agents Need Vacation Time</h2>
<p>If you earn in excess of $100,000, you <a href="/blog/a-portrait-of-the-agent-realtor-habit-survey/">probably</a> work more hours than your colleagues who make less money. In fact, around 40 percent of agents in that income bracket work more than 50 hours a week, according to an Inman study. And the hours increase with income: More than 50 percent of agents that earn $200,000 or more work more than 50 hours a week.</p>
<p>That amount of time spent working means stress, fewer hours spent with family and no time to yourself—potentially a recipe for disaster. “The impact that taking a vacation has on one&#8217;s mental health is profound,” clinical psychologist Francine Lederer <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/vacations-2011-time-off-improves-productivity-reducing-stress/story?id=14293331">tells ABC News</a>. &#8220;Most people have better life perspective and are more motivated to achieve their goals after a vacation, even if it is a 24-hour time-out.&#8221;</p>
<p>If that doesn’t convince you that you need time off periodically, consider the famous <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/07/business/yourmoney/07shortcuts.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;">Framingham Heart Study</a>. The results found that women who seldom vacationed—every six years or less—were eight times more likely to have a heart attack or to develop heart disease than those who took at least two vacations each year.</p>
<p>“It shows how the body reacts to a lifestyle of stress. This is real evidence that vacations are important to your physical health,” Elaine Eaker, a co-author of the study, told the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/07/business/yourmoney/07shortcuts.html?pagewanted=all">New York Times</a>. Another study cited by the Times showed that men who didn’t take a vacation every year were 32 percent more likely to die from a heart attack than those who did take an annual getaway.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s scary to think of leaving your clients and your business behind. But leave you must, for both your mental and physical health. Here are some ideas for how you can do it.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Take on a Partner</h2>
<p>If you are so busy that you wouldn’t dream of taking vacation time for fear that your real estate business would fall apart, maybe it’s time to take on a partner. Yes, you’ll be splitting your commissions, but with two sets of commissions coming in, you may not even feel a pinch.</p>
<p>A partner can take over the business while you take some time off. “You can take vacations—real vacations—ones where you do NO work,” author, speaker and real estate trainer Kelle Sparta <a href="http://activerain.com/blogsview/950580/working-with-a-partner---the-team-approach-to-real-estate">says on ActiveRain</a>. “It means, in short, a higher quality of life.”</p>
<p>Trainer and author Jennifer Allan-Hagedorn says that “One of the toughest things about being self-employed is finding someone reliable to watch your business so that you can get away… vacation coverage is a prime benefit to having a partner.”</p>
<p>“It’s blissful actually, especially if you’ve been selling real estate a long time. Your first vacation when you truly don’t have to worry about business? You’ll wonder why you didn’t get a partner before,” Hagedorn concludes.</p>
<p>Alas, partnerships aren’t for everyone. If that includes you, read on.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Hire Someone</h2>
<p>When you expand your solo practice to a team, you aren’t really “hiring” other agents any more than your broker hired you. They remain independent contractors. Most solo agents hire a buyer’s agent first. That agent is perfectly capable of handling your clients while you’re out of town to enjoy some time off.</p>
<p>If you insist on remaining solo, at least think about taking on an assistant. A licensed assistant can perform most of the duties that will be required in your absence. A <a href="/blog/real-estate-virtual-assistant/">virtual assistant</a> or <a href="/blog/real-estate-interns/">intern</a> can help lighten your workload with administrative tasks.</p>
<h2 class="BlogH2">Borrow Someone</h2>
<p>If you don’t want to partner up and you can’t stand the thought of hiring anyone, but you need some time off, hand over your current business to a fellow agent in your office. You’ll have to be willing to split your commission, of course, but if you agree with the psychologists and studies mentioned about the importance of taking time off, it will be worth it.</p>
<p>If push comes to shove, take just one day off to start. Explore your local area, hike, bike, go to a movie or get reacquainted with your family. Make sure you unplug the phone and keep the laptop closed. This is no-work time, no matter what.</p>The post <a href="https://www.marketleader.com/blog/real-estate-agent-vacation-time/">Get Out of Town!

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Five actionable insights to heed today as you navigate a new normal. </span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feelings of panic, hesitation, and fear pervaded the real estate industry through most of the spring selling season. Now that the dust has settled and markets are rebounding nationwide, summer selling season is upon us and it’s time to kick your business into gear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We sat down (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">virtually</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">) with Aubie Pouncey – a powerhouse agent and team leader serving the greater Seattle area – to discuss how tech will continue to shape our industry, the data that drives it, and how you can leverage both to have the right conversations, and dominate your market in today’s new normal.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Technology is here to stay.</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The real estate industry has long struggled to adopt technology and if there’s one glaring effect the pandemic has had on industries worldwide is the acceleration of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">technology adoption. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology will continue to drive the real estate industry, post-pandemic. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumers were already interacting with the market digitally, leaning on agents to facilitate negotiations and the transaction itself; agents who struggled to adopt (and adapt) before can now lean into technology to be a bigger part of the consumer experience. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aubie says: Consider an agent whose largest source of business was open houses. All of their eggs were in one basket, and now they can&#8217;t get in front of people. </span></h3>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s an agent’s job to take things digital faster than their competitors and find ways to provide value in new mediums. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Today&#8217;s consumer is the same, but different.</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumer behavior has been changing for decades. Despite a lot of agents who, pre-pandemic, were hanging on to the idea of real estate being a belly-to-belly industry, it just isn’t anymore. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pre-pandemic, consumers already preferred a more digital experience. They are empowered and can browse homes online and conduct their own research. Today, those agents who have been slow to understand changing consumer expectations are forced to adapt and we think it will serve them well. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aubie says: Open all doors of communication and see which one they walk back through.</span></h3>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Call, text and email any new leads and let them interact with you on their terms. Give them options and let them know you are always there. No pressure is key. It is about giving them options and doors to walk through. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. When you make it about you, you lose.</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don&#8217;t let your own insecurity ruin a deal. Provide resources and value. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can&#8217;t force someone into the market, but you can provide them with resources and information that helps them make the best decisions for can themselves. If they don&#8217;t end up working with you, but you provided them with value, they&#8217;ll remember that down the road &#8211; whether their situation changes and they become ready to work with an agent or if they cross paths with someone looking to buy or sell. The seeds you sow today can be harvested for years to come. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aubie says: It&#8217;s about the model and the process.</span></h3>
</blockquote>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Let the numbers tell the story.</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is driving the market? What is driving YOUR market? People care about how things acutely affect them. It’s not about the overall market, it&#8217;s about THEIR market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Become the local economist and share market data as it relates to them. Are you a buyers agent? What does the data in your market say about new listings and mortgage rates? Are you a listing agent? What does the data say about buyer activity and how record low mortgage rates are creating an increased demand? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use data to tell your market’s story as it relates to your audience. Distill the numbers in a way that both makes sense and eases concerns. Note: y</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ou’ve got to understand the data so you can share it. Get comfortable with it and spend time understanding it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don&#8217;t underestimate how easy it is to access data. Google, local REALTORS associations, MLSs and your brokerage are all great resources. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. The new world has its sights set on rural. </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One glaring impact the pandemic has had across the country: people no longer want to be in densely populated areas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People with underlying health issues and compromised immune systems are relocating entirely. Large populations of people living in urban areas are now remote, free to live and work from anywhere. People who have options will exercise them.</span></p>
<p>While the world starts to settle into our new, foreseeable normal, agents have a massive opportunity to step up and capitalize on some of the disruption caused a few short months ago.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aubie says: Pivot, find the market of the minute and connect with those people who need resources.</span></h3>
</blockquote>
