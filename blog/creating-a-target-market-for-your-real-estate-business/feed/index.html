					<description><![CDATA[I have a 3000 acre tract just north of the Florida line in Georgia near Folkston Georgia. I am selling 20 and higher tracts and providing owner financing with 10% down and prices starting at $2500 per acre. I am selling to clients basically in the Jacksonville area (60 miles away) with some from farther areas. It is a great piece of property but the absorption rate is slow with only around 600 acres sold so far in the last 2 years. I know clients in the north would love this land for an investment and/or retirement property, but do not know how to market to out of state prospects. I see many residential properties marketed in central florida and would like to know how to successfully target prospects out of state. Does anyone have any suggestions?]]></description>
