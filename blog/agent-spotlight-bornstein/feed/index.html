					<description><![CDATA[Hard to become a bkreor not really.Hard to succeed depends on you.Make no mistake, this is hard work. Networking, selling, cold calling, canvasing, etc., be prepared to work and not necessarily make any money for the first few months. I didn&#039;t get a check for the first 8 months I was in the business. If you work hard and have a good mentor, you can avoid a lot of mistakes and save some time. Find a firm that is willing to invest some time to train you and make sure you are part of a selling team. It will make things a lot easier. The income can be enormous I know more than a handful of guys in my market (Long Island) who make well over a million dollars per year. Lots of bkreors here make between $ 100,000   $ 300,000. But remember, it&#039;s all commission (you eat what you kill) Good luck!Ralph Benzakeinwhitman-realty.com]]></description>
