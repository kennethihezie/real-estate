					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for a great article, Alyssa!
We are going to work on our blog and hopefully that will increase our traffic overtime. I understand, that the more the better, but in reality - how many blog posts/week could help to increase traffic?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketleader.com/blog/organic-traffic-isnt-free-beginner-seo-tips-for-agents/#comment-402&quot;&gt;Adam&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi Adam,

SEO does often take a long time to see results if you ever see result, but that said I would not ignore it completely. Focus making your site a search friendly with a good user experience for your potential customers, that will pay off no matter how you get your traffic.

Make sure when setting up your paid search/traffic campaign you consider the quality of the visitors and what they are expecting from your page. A paid traffic campaign is a great way to boost your site, but 10,000 visitors don&#039;t mean anything unless they convert to leads and sales. Remember in online advertising that quality of the visitor often trumps the quantity.

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Alyssa
I am thinking of going down the paid traffic route to give my website a boost. I think I try to drip feed 10,000 visitors over 5-6 week. I find the SEO route takes too long to see any result, what&#039;s your opinion.
