					<description><![CDATA[the most important thing is COMMUNICATION!!  It is frustrating to sit and wait mth after mth and never hear a word from the realtor....we never know what&#039;s going on.  my realtor has trouble opening up the house, therefore, we are called ONLY when he has someone to show it to. That means there are weeks and mths that go by with NOT ONE WORD from the realtor...that is NOT acceptable!! Most sellers don&#039;t know the ropes until a yr has passed and then they get sick and tired of waiting for a &#039;crumb&#039; to be tossed their way about what is happening with THEIR HOME...ridiculous.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My second most important expectation is communication.  I rarely hear from my realtor, including after my home has been shown to let me know the potential buyer has left and it is clear for me to go home.  We have a dog and cats that we are packing up and taking with us each time and as yet I have not received the &quot;all clear&quot; without having to call or text to ask, and sometimes not at all.]]></description>
