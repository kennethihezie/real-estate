Sure, every other agent and broker has a Facebook page, Twitter account or blog, but you shouldn\u2019t promote your brand through social media just because it\u2019s what the Jones are doing down the street.<\/p>\n<h2>What Social Media Can Accomplish<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-8001\" title=\"socia media marketing\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/11\/Fotolia_37877338_XS-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"socia media marketing\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" \/>It\u2019s important to understand the many benefits associated with social media campaigns. According to Neal Cabage, the managing director of Enlogica.com, \u201cSocial media is mostly a &#8220;high funnel&#8221; channel, meaning that you are using it to make introductions to your brand and nurture those leads, so that you are top of mind when they are ready to buy or sell real estate in the future. Social media rarely results in near term closing or sales conversion but it is frequently a &#8220;first touch&#8221; or assisting touch point in a longer term marketing campaign.\u201d Everything you do in your social media campaign must support your brand. If you are an expert in commercial real estate, it does little good posting blogs about residential properties. Define who you are through your social media campaign.<\/p>\n<h2>How to Define Yourself<\/h2>\n<p>You don\u2019t need to spend a lot of money hiring a graphic designer to create an ultra hip website or flashy business cards. According to Dominic Morrocco, co-founder of M Squared Real Estate, \u201cMany agents think of their brand as a shiny logo or unique color scheme. When actually, it\u2019s the specific knowledge they possess. From originating new content regarding current changes in the market, new legislative initiatives and local happenings, agents brand themselves as knowledgeable professionals, active in the communities they serve.\u201d Just like your top listings, you should sell yourself with the same amount of enthusiasm.<\/p>\n<p>To create your own unique brand, think about these five things:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why are your services valuable to clients?<\/li>\n<li>What do you have to offer that is different than other real estate agents or brokers?<\/li>\n<li>Come up with a brand that is difficult for others to imitate.<\/li>\n<li>Create a punchy tagline that will help people remember you. For example, Nike\u2019s \u201cjust do it\u201d campaign won them worldwide recognition.<\/li>\n<li>What are you passionate about?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Being Passionate = Staying Focused<\/h2>\n<p>Being passionate about any topic will help prevent social media burnout or general lack of focus. \u201cTo do content and social marketing effectively, you need to become the thought leader on a given topic and that&#8217;s going to mean following the latest news and researching the topic more deeply so you can speak to it authoritatively.\u00a0Approach this as an overall effort to brand yourself, don&#8217;t just do it for social marketing. This is not only going to be what separates your brand from others, it will be perceived as more authentic if it is your consistent brand,\u201d says Neal Cabage. If you love reporting about different restaurant openings, cultural events or community festivals in your area, write blog postings about these topics. Those who care about interior design can connect to their target market by writing about home renovation or how to add value to property. Becoming a leading authority on something specific will contribute value to your brand.<\/p>\n<h2>Creating a Social Media Schedule<\/h2>\n<p>If you wait around until you feel inspired to write a blog or a post on Facebook, you won\u2019t establish a consistent schedule. Inconsistency is not the hallmark of a successful business or social marketing campaign. \u201cSpend an hour a day either originating new content, or curating existing content that you deem relevant.\u00a0Whip out a calendar and mark some days of the week off.\u00a0Here\u2019s a good schedule for you: 1) Monday: best deals under $500,000. 2) Tuesday: Backyard entertaining: best deals with great outdoor space. 3) Wednesday: mid-week roundup: properties on the move, etc.,\u201d says Dominic Morrocco. If you are using Twitter as part of your social marketing campaign, post more often than you would for a blog or Facebook. People don\u2019t read all of their Twitter posts. You don\u2019t have to always come up with a new subject or topic for your \u201ctweets.\u201d In fact, questions such as \u201cAre you ready for this weekend\u2019s big storm?\u201d can establish a connection to your target market and illicit responses that will keep people engaged. Your next post can share a list of open houses that people can check out to get out of the rain.<\/p>\n<h2>Things to Remember<\/h2>\n<p>If you aren\u2019t interested in your social media campaign, it probably isn\u2019t interesting to anyone else. Come up with creative ideas to promote your brand. Treating social media as a fun challenge will help you stay focused and breathe life into your marketing strategies.<\/p>\n<p><em>Do you use social media campaigns to promote your real estate business?
