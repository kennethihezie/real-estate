If those days spent \u201cin the groove\u201d are few and far between, consider changing or updating your workspace, your processes, your tools and your systems.<\/p>\n<p>Productivity is the name of the game that leads to more closed sales and a higher income. \u201cThe potential for associations, brokers and agents to better understand which tools \u2026 lead to improved productivity has the potential to help them change their own practices and increase revenue,\u201d according to Scout Research.<\/p>\n<h2>Work Environment<\/h2>\n<p>Whether you work from home or have a company-provided office or cubicle, your environment plays a big role in how productive you are. Of course, with a home office you have a lot more freedom to set it up just how you want, but a little creativity in a broker-supplied office can go a long way.<\/p>\n<p>Think about what inspires you and, more importantly, what distracts you. It\u2019s great to have a window from which to gaze while you work, but if what is going on outside is more interesting than your current project, you won\u2019t get much done.<\/p>\n<p>Furniture should be functional yet comfy, especially your chair, for those days when you\u2019re stuck in the office instead of showing property.<\/p>\n<p>Create an organizational system for paperwork, files and office supplies. Use wall space to keep important items front and center, such as your monthly plan, information about deals in progress, to-do lists and schedules.<\/p>\n<h2>Forget About Multitasking<\/h2>\n<p>Our brains can only handle so much at any given time, according to Guy Winch, author of \u201cEmotional First Aid: Practical Strategies for Treating Failure, Rejection, Guilt and Other Everyday Psychological Injuries.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Spreading your attention among several tasks shortchanges all of them, he says, never allowing you to get in the groove for any one task. While he believes that multitasking wastes time, he feels that doing tasks in batches \u2013 all emails at once, returning phone calls in one session and the like \u2013 saves time.<\/p>\n<h2>Delegating Work<\/h2>\n<p>\u201cTop production cannot be achieved without learning to organize and share the work,\u201d claims the Keller Williams Realty Agent Productivity Workshop.<\/p>\n<p>If you aren\u2019t keen on taking on a partner to share the work with, consider hiring an assistant. To determine if you\u2019re ready to take on an assistant, the National Association of Realtors\u00ae has a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nar.realtor\/rmoquiz2.nsf\/assistantquiz?openform\">quiz<\/a> to help you decide.<\/p>\n<p>An assistant can manage the tasks that don\u2019t require your attention yet still need to be done, freeing you for more important tasks. If you\u2019re worried about breaking the budget, hire a part-time virtual assistant.<\/p>\n<p>Whether virtual or on-site, delegating administrative tasks gets all that \u201cstuff\u201d off your desk and helps your workspace help you become more productive.<\/p>\n<h2>Lean on Technology<\/h2>\n<p>Few things can help streamline your day better than technology. Tools such as apps, a CRM and tablets, help systemize your business, which is vital to your productivity.<\/p>\n<p>Look for systems that automate the more time-consuming tasks you perform every week, such as email follow-ups.<\/p>\n<p>Next, think about lead management. Is your CRM doing all that it can and should be doing? If not, it may be time to upgrade to a more robust system<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t forget to amp up your productivity in the field. The National Association of Realtors\u00ae says that agents\u2019 top three mobile tools include the iPad, a smartphone and a digital camera. Start there and load up on more as your business becomes more productive. If you need apps, the NAR has a list of useful <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nar.realtor\/stay-connected\/apps\">mobile apps<\/a> on its website.<\/p>\n<h2>Get Out of Town<\/h2>\n<p>\u201cParadoxically, the best way to get more done may be to spend more time doing less,\u201d claims Tony Schwartz at the New York Times. He goes on to cite research that shows how \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/02\/10\/opinion\/sunday\/relax-youll-be-more-productive.html?_r=0\">strategic renewal<\/a>,\u201d such as a break from work to hit the gym, an afternoon nap, and more and longer vacations boost productivity.<\/p>\n<p>Who knew that all the things we think will slow us down actually propel us to greater productivity?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Most agents have the occasional day when everything runs smoothly and each task is completed on time.
