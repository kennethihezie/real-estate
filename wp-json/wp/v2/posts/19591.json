Like a politician who says one thing to get elected and something completely different after we vote for him, a real estate agent who sells herself one way and doesn\u2019t deliver on those promises won\u2019t be getting many referrals. Nobody wants to be that agent.<\/p>\n<p>Even following up on what you explicitly promise may not be enough to meet a client\u2019s expectations, however. Maybe you don\u2019t promise consistent communication, but I\u2019m willing to wager that most, if not all, of your clients expect it.<\/p>\n<p>A wise broker once said: \u201cNever take a current client for granted.\u201d In other words, real estate agents should never view a current client as a \u201cdone deal.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Tick-Tock: Time Management<\/h2>\n<p>Time \u2013 that pesky commodity we have so little of. Trying to squeeze everything that needs to be done into a typical work day can be a full-time job in itself. How you use time, however, may just determine your success in the real estate industry \u2013 at least according to Keller Williams\u2019 Englewood, Colo. trainer and agent Renee Helten.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe all have the same 168 hours a week,\u201d she reminds us. \u201cWhat makes it so that one person is more successful than somebody else is the way in which they use that finite amount of time,\u201d Helten said.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s all about prioritizing what needs to be done and then plugging those priorities into the time you have available. Sure, you will invariably end up with too many duties left undone, and that\u2019s when you need to be creative and find a way to \u201cmake\u201d time.<\/p>\n<h2>Phone Calls<\/h2>\n<p>One way to do this is to commit to the telephone one evening a week and use it to call all your current clients. If you consistently call your clients on a specific night every week, they\u2019ll learn to expect it and will typically hold their questions for your weekly call instead of blowing up your cell phone while you\u2019re working in the daytime.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, it\u2019s time-consuming, but so is chasing after clients, which you won\u2019t have to do anymore when your business runs on a referral base. Spend the time now or in the future \u2013 it\u2019s your choice.<\/p>\n<h2>Hire and Delegate<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re so busy, or you have so many clients that you can\u2019t find the time to check in with them, maybe it\u2019s time to hire an assistant.<\/p>\n<p>While an unlicensed assistant may be a lifesaver in other aspects of your business, you may want to consider hiring a licensed assistant to perform your client contact duties. There are advantages and disadvantages to both, according to the pros at Keller Williams Realty.<\/p>\n<p>The biggest advantage to a licensed assistant is that he or she is already real-estate savvy and doesn\u2019t need training. The biggest disadvantage is that the licensed assistant may cost more and may have an eye toward bringing in her own clients.<\/p>\n<p>The assistant you do choose needs to be able to answer questions about the transactions &#8211; how they are progressing &#8211; and keep detailed notes of the conversations. She should also communicate with your clients via their preferred method, whether it\u2019s by phone, text or email.<\/p>\n<h2>Written Communication<\/h2>\n<p>The bulk of client communication takes place when you first meet your clients, whether homeowners or buyers. The real estate transaction process is complicated for most consumers, and a good agent takes the time to walk his clients through it.<\/p>\n<p>Consider using written content to do this for you. Kris Lindahl, an agent with Edina Realty in Minnesota, provides his clients with free e-books at the outset of a transaction. He has one for sellers, one for buyers, one for veterans, one for short sellers, and one for folks who are interested in using a USDA Rural Development Loan. An extremely busy agent, these e-books save him hours every week. And his clients enjoy having the information at their fingertips.<\/p>\n<p>E-books are easy to put together using blog posts, or hire a ghostwriter to write them for you.<\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t like the idea of e-books, perhaps you\u2019ll consider putting that same type of content on your website. Basic, beginner articles on everything from shopping for a lender to what happens at closing will save you the time of having to explain the processes to clients.<\/p>\n<h2>What to Communicate<\/h2>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve decided that you need to get better at communication, decide what you\u2019ll say to your clients. That\u2019s easy to do if you keep a running summary of all of the activity performed for each client.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Listing information &#8211;<\/strong> It\u2019s loaded into the MLS, the sign company will be out tomorrow, the lockbox goes on tonight, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What you\u2019ve done since the last contact &#8211;<\/strong> Spoke with a buyer\u2019s agent about the home\u2019s square footage, refilled the flyer canister, ordered the preliminary title report, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Neighborhood news &#8211;<\/strong> New listings and sales, or listings that have received offers, are always interesting to buyers and sellers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Action plan &#8211;<\/strong> What you are planning for the coming week.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Client concerns &#8211;<\/strong> Finally, ask if they have any questions or concerns.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>On her website, Las Vegas super-agent Lori Ballen summed up her experiences at a recent Hear it Direct conference. She said of the buyers on the panel: \u201cThey ALL want more communication.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As proof, the Gen Y panel moderator asked one consumer about the shortcomings of her real estate agent. \u201cShe didn\u2019t tell you what the process was going to be?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d answered the consumer.<\/p>\n<p>Nobody wants to be that agent. Find time to communicate, to explain the process, and to counsel your clients.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Remember all those reasons you gave your clients for hiring you in the first place?
