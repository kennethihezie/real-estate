After a lifetime of working as an administrative assistant, in direct sales and then in the real estate industry, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.searchcrystalcoasthomes.com\">Debbie King<\/a>, of King Realty, assumed she\u2019d retire by age 55. That momentous date has come and gone and she\u2019s still at it, selling Crystal Coast homes in Newport, N.C.<\/p>\n<h2>Real Estate \u2013 The Happiness Business<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s happiness that gets King up in the mornings and keeps her coming back every day. \u201cWhen clients are happy with their purchase, just the smile on their face \u2013 that just sounds really dorky \u2013 but the fact that I have had a huge part in making them happy is so rewarding,\u201d she explains. \u201cI know that every morning when they wake up they\u2019re going to be grateful that they got that house, and that\u2019s truly it for me.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>King got her real estate license a decade ago and spent her initial years selling new homes with KB Homes. Today, she is the owner-operator of her own boutique brokerage.<\/p>\n<h2>Challenges<\/h2>\n<p>Something happens to a real estate practice at the 10-year mark. A lot of it is good \u2013 like the repeat business that typically starts rolling in at this time. We asked King about some of the challenges she faces at the decade anniversary of her business. \u201cThere\u2019s not a huge challenge,\u201d she replied, \u201cjust lots of little bitty ones. My biggest challenge would probably be getting people qualified for loans.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Marketing<\/h2>\n<p>King credits her Market Leader website as the key to her team\u2019s success. \u201cWithout it, real estate would be pointless,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we do with Market Leader has just been phenomenal.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>She became familiar with Market Leader accidentally. \u201cI had a bad experience with another company. Somebody from Market Leader sales called in a moment of weakness and I said, \u2018Sure, I\u2019ll try it.\u2019\u201d She also says it\u2019s the best business decision she has ever made.<\/p>\n<h2>Off the Clock<\/h2>\n<p>When King isn\u2019t busy running a successful real estate brokerage you\u2019ll find her in her own slice of heaven on earth. \u201cWe recently made a huge investment in our own backyard. We\u2019ve pretty much got our own paradise there with an in-ground pool and everything we could want,\u201d she explained.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHonestly, we would never just take some time to pack up and leave for the weekend, but with our own little paradise right in the backyard, I can go out there for two hours in the morning and feel like I\u2018ve just come back from a vacation. Same thing in the afternoon \u2013 my flexible schedule lets me do that. That\u2019s what I do when I\u2019m not working \u2013 just enjoy life.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>10 More Years<\/h2>\n<p>We asked King where she sees herself in 10 years. Without hesitation she said, \u201cCozumel, on the beach,\u201d laughing. She added, however, that she has a sneaking suspicion she\u2019ll be doing real estate deals from that beach chair.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m 59 years old and I had thought I\u2019d be retired by 55,\u201d King continued. \u201cI think now that if I had retired I\u2019d be one bored chick. I have my moments when I want to quit, but I have more where I say, \u2018I just love it so much.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Retirement doesn\u2019t come easy to some.
