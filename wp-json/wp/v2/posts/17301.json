What\u2019s that, you ask? \u201cI supervised the staff and managed the facilities,\u201d Monson explains. \u201cIt was a big, big job.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, she and her husband were buying and selling properties, by-owner. \u201cIt was before flipping became a bad word,\u201d she says. \u201cWe would buy them at auction and fix them up. They were beautiful when we were done, and we\u2019d sell them, and we were doing pretty well at that.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>They did so well, in fact, that the last home, out of 20 in total, sold for more than her annual salary at the law firm.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI remember thinking, \u2018Why am I killing myself?\u2019 I figured that if we did a couple of these a year, I could quit working.\u201d Instead of quitting work altogether, though, she decided to get her real estate license.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI actually took a vacation from the law firm, and I went through all of the classes, and I got my license quite quickly,\u201d Monson says. \u201cI stayed at the law firm for another couple of months and then left to start my career in real estate. I\u2019ve been an agent for nine years now.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I asked Monson what her biggest challenge is at this point in her career.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think the biggest challenge is the way that real estate shifts so frequently,\u201d she begins. \u201cThere are just a lot of changes all the time, and I\u2019m discovering that the best way to manage that, for an agent, is to have good people around you,\u201d Monson continues.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou have to have a good lender, you have to have good title people, you have to have a good brokerage to rely on and good tools to help you with the changes. Otherwise, you\u2019d be lost. It would be an overwhelming job keeping up with this,\u201d she concludes.<\/p>\n<h2>Marketing<\/h2>\n<p>Monson swears by her Market Leader website. \u201cI love the Market Insider, I send lots of my people to that,\u201d she explains. \u201cIn fact, I just recorded a video blog about the Market Insider. It\u2019s an incredible tool for my past and future clients.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Monson also uses direct mail and &#8211; look out, dirty words coming up &#8211; cold calling.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u201c<\/strong>Nobody likes it,\u201d she agrees. \u201cIf they did, everyone would cold call and then it would be less effective. I have to tell you, because everyone doesn\u2019t do it, it makes me unique,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA lot of times my business doesn\u2019t come directly from the cold calls, but it\u2019s amazing how stuff comes from unexpected places as a result of the calls,\u201d she explains.<\/p>\n<h2>Sellers or Buyers?<\/h2>\n<p>Monson is primarily a listing agent &#8211; except for this year. \u201cThis year\u2019s been a little weird for me because I\u2019ve done more buyers than I did last year. Last year, out of all my transactions, I only did about four or five buyer\u2019s sides, but this year, so far, I\u2019ve done about 12 buyer\u2019s sides,\u201d Monson explains.<\/p>\n<h2>Indispensable Tools<\/h2>\n<p>I asked Monson to tell us about the one tool that is most critical to her real estate business.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe contact management that Market Leader provides, absolutely,\u201d she replies.<\/p>\n<p>Monson adopted Market Leader products when she worked with Keller Williams. \u201cI had Top Producer and it was just too clunky and complicated,\u201d she recalls. \u201cIt\u2019s very feature-rich, don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s an excellent product. It was just too hard to accomplish what I wanted,\u201d she claims.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI tried several other products and then Keller Williams came out with their affiliation with Market Leader,\u201d Monson continues. \u201cI started looking at it and I really liked the interface, and the upgrade that I immediately purchased was everything that four or five of the other services I was paying for were. I was actually able to consolidate some of my expenses,\u201d she concludes.<\/p>\n<h2>A Peek Into the Future<\/h2>\n<p>Life has a tendency to intervene in even the best laid plans, but taking a peek into her life a decade from now, Monson sees herself as retired.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI see myself doing more and more business for the next four or five years and then, honestly, retiring,\u201d she predicts. \u201cIt will be somewhere warm.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>To that end, Monson has a trip to Ecuador planned in the next couple of months to check it out as a retirement destination. \u201cIt\u2019s the number-one rated international retirement community for expats,\u201d she claims.<\/p>\n<p>So, what does this self-described tenacious real estate agent like best about her career?<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI enjoy the people I work with,\u201d she begins. \u201cI\u2019ve got to tell you, I\u2019ve had some amazing clients during my real estate career. I\u2019m always thrilled to bits to help them accomplish not only a financial goal but a lifestyle goal as well. It\u2019s a lot of fun.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Nobody knows an area better than a local &#8211; someone who was born and raised there.
