But if you know what you\u2019re doing, it\u2019s less intimidating and more productive.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless of what you\u2019ve heard or imagined, real estate cold calling can still be an effective lead generation strategy. That\u2019s true even though it is \u201cold school,\u201d and even if there are many ways to fail.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">Why Cold Calling Is Still Worthy of Consideration<\/h2>\n<p>If real estate cold calling seems like an old-fashioned strategy, that\u2019s because it is. But like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/blog\/real-estate-direct-mail\/\">direct mail marketing<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/blog\/door-knocking-real-estate\/\">door knocking<\/a>, there\u2019s a reason it\u2019s been a common sales tactic for as long as it has: it works.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s be honest. Upon first glance, the statistics about how good of an ROI cold calling offers aren\u2019t encouraging. For example, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zippia.com\/advice\/cold-calling-statistics\/\">a recent study<\/a> indicated that roughly one in three prospects will pick up when you call, and only one percent of cold calls will lead to an appointment.<\/p>\n<p>But that doesn\u2019t show the whole picture. Because many top-performing agents consider cold calling to be an essential part of their business plan. They\u2019ve filled their pipelines by \u201cdialing for dollars,\u201d and it\u2019s led to serious commission income increases year after year.<\/p>\n<p>This discrepancy seems to highlight an important point: Real estate cold calling isn\u2019t just a numbers game. Success comes as a result of discipline, hard work, and a bit of technique. Not plugging away until you experience some random luck.<\/p>\n<p>Top-performing agents know how to capitalize on the few opportunities they get. They know how to get warm leads out of cold calls. And that\u2019s doable for you, too, as long as you follow some tried-and-true techniques.<\/p>\n<p>So let\u2019s dive into the best practices so you can be among the many expert agents who leverage cold calling to close more deals.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">8 Pro Tips for Real Estate Cold Calling<\/h2>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">1. Understand the Law<\/h3>\n<p>Cold calling in real estate isn\u2019t foolproof. There are many ways it can go wrong. Getting into legal trouble is among the worst ways to fail.<\/p>\n<p>The Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TPCA) was created in 1991 to protect consumers from pesky telemarketers. It applies to \u201cany person, business, or entity that conducts telephone solicitations,\u201d which includes real estate agents.<\/p>\n<p>The TCPA is important to mention here because both the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have the regulatory powers to enforce it. The last thing you want as a result of trying to generate leads is a lawsuit.<\/p>\n<p>And beware: today there are more than 220 million numbers on the FCC\u2019s official <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ftc.gov\/news-events\/topics\/do-not-call-registry\">Do Not Call Registry<\/a>. If you call numbers on the registry, you could face a fine of up to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rd.com\/list\/truth-about-do-not-call-list\/\">$40,000<\/a> for each call.<\/p>\n<p>So what does this mean for you? Essentially it means you need to comply with the following:<\/p>\n<ul class=\"BlogUL\">\n<li class=\"BlogLI\">Restrict your calls to hours between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m.<\/li>\n<li class=\"BlogLI\">Be transparent: immediately tell the recipient who you are and the name of your business<\/li>\n<li class=\"BlogLI\">Don\u2019t block your phone number from the recipient\u2019s caller I.D.<\/li>\n<li class=\"BlogLI\">Search the registry for every cold call you make to ensure you aren\u2019t contacting anyone who\u2019s on that list<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For more details about how to cold call in real estate without breaking the law, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nar.realtor\/telemarketing-cold-calling\">check out NAR\u2019s quick summary<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">2. Prepare<\/h3>\n<p>Do the proper research before you call so you can speak knowledgeably about your prospect\u2019s situation and provide thorough responses to any questions that might come up. For example: if you\u2019re cold calling a potential seller, familiarize yourself with the neighborhood, know the area\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.realtor.com\/research\/market-trends\/\">median listing price<\/a>, and compile a handful of nearby listing comps for reference.<\/p>\n<p>Prepare your lines beforehand. Use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/2022-Call-Scripts-Guide.pdf\">the most effective real estate call scripts<\/a> and adjust them to fit your personality and the specific situation.<\/p>\n<p>Then practice. Rehearse your main talking points. Call yourself and leave a voicemail to assess your delivery.<\/p>\n<p>Ask a friend, family member, or colleague to play the role of an inquisitive consumer so you can practice fielding questions, addressing concerns, and handling objections. Work toward sounding as natural as possible.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">3. Resist the Urge To Sell<\/h3>\n<p>Be relational, not salesy. No one wants to feel like they\u2019re being used to boost your bottom line. So be friendly and provide value. Demonstrate that you actually care about them as a person.<\/p>\n<p>How can you do that? By listening to what they say, taking notes, and repeating their own words back to them throughout the conversation. Tailor your approach specifically to their pain points and show how you\u2019re the agent who can provide the help they need.<\/p>\n<p>Your ultimate goal, of course, is to turn them into a client. But that\u2019s not what this call is about. You\u2019re not going to sign any contracts after a single phone call.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, focus on being genuinely helpful, and replace your ultimate goal with a much smaller one for the time being: to get them to take the next step (which, for example, might be something as simple as scheduling a follow-up call).<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">4. Set a (Realistic) Daily Cold Calling Goal<\/h3>\n<p>Aiming for 500 cold calls a day is admirable, but it\u2019s also a recipe for burnout.<\/p>\n<p>First, establish your commission income goals. Then determine how many calls you\u2019ll need to get there.<\/p>\n<p>For example, let\u2019s say you want to earn $75,000 this year in commissions and you\u2019re on a 10 percent split with your broker. That means you\u2019ll need to close slightly less than $2.8 million worth of real estate sales. (The breakdown: $75,000 of total commissions income \u00f7 90% to account for the split \u00f7 3% if that\u2019s the transaction commission rate.) If the median sale price of a home in your area was $285,000, you\u2019d need to close 10 deals a year to reach (and slightly exceed) your commission goal.<\/p>\n<p>(If you want the quickest, easiest way to find out how many leads you\u2019ll need to reach your annual income goal, use Market Leader\u2019s free <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/leadcalculator\/\">Lead Calculator<\/a>. Simply punch in the numbers you\u2019re aiming for, and the calculator will tell you how many transactions and leads you\u2019ll need across all lead sources.)<\/p>\n<p>Also, this is where investing in your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/solutions\/crm\/\">CRM<\/a> pays off. Analyze the data it provides to determine how many contacts it took you to generate the deals you closed last year.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">5. Call at the \u201cRight Time\u201d<\/h3>\n<p>If you still don\u2019t feel all warm and fuzzy about real estate cold calling, consider getting it out of the way as soon as possible so you can avoid procrastinating. Many agents like to make telephone prospecting the first thing they do every morning so they can get it off their mind and their to-do list.<\/p>\n<p>Is that the best time to call? It could be. But as long as you comply with the FCC\u2019s limitations, of course, any time may be a good time for you and your prospects.<\/p>\n<p>You could go the route of following the statistics. For example, findings from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.revenue.io\/blog\/the-best-time-to-cold-call-prospects-in-2020\">one recent study<\/a> suggested that \u201cdecision makers are more likely to engage in the late afternoon,\u201d with engagement rates peaking \u201cduring the 4-5 p.m. hour.\u201d And data from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.execvision.io\/blog\/best-time-cold-call\/\">another study<\/a> showed that \u201cthe best time to cold call a prospect is between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., with 10 a.m. (15.53%) and 2 p.m. (15.01%) providing the best response times.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Studies like those might provide a good starting point. But ultimately, you need to find what works best for you and your prospects. That\u2019s going to require some trial and error.<\/p>\n<p>Hypothesize about what might work best, give it a try, track your results, and repeat the process until you\u2019ve found a time range that yields the highest results. Once you\u2019ve identified the ideal times to call, make that a regular part of your schedule and stick to it.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">6. Demonstrate Your Value Immediately<\/h3>\n<p>The prospect should immediately learn 1) who you are and 2) what you bring to the table. And they should know both of those things <em>before<\/em> they can even begin to consider objections.<\/p>\n<p>Sharing who you are is easy \u2013 just start off the call by mentioning your name and, if applicable, the name of your business or brokerage. But how can you demonstrate your value?<\/p>\n<ul class=\"BlogUL\">\n<li class=\"BlogLI\"><strong>Share a version of your unique value proposition<\/strong>, a statement that expresses how you\u2019re different (and better!) than your competitors. (Don\u2019t have one? <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/blog\/real-estate-marketing-plan\/\">Market Leader\u2019s free real estate marketing plan<\/a> walks you through the process of creating a unique value proposition, vision statement, and mission statement.)<\/li>\n<li class=\"BlogLI\"><strong>Share your enthusiasm.<\/strong> Think of Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s famous line: \u201cNobody cares how much you know until they know how much you care.\u201d Demonstrating your level of expertise is very important (which is why it\u2019s our next point), but it\u2019s not the only thing that matters when cold calling \u2013 you also need to show that you have their best interest at heart. Your prospect is looking for an advocate and cheerleader, not just a consultant.<\/li>\n<li class=\"BlogLI\"><strong>Share what you know.<\/strong> By translating not only facts and figures but also your interpretation, insights, and conclusions based on the data, you\u2019re essentially saying, \u201cI\u2019m the local expert, I\u2019ve put in the hard work to understand this market at a granular level, and I\u2019m bringing a kind of value that no other agent can provide.\u201d It\u2019s that kind of analysis that will put you leagues beyond what your prospects can find on Zillow.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">7. Be Memorable<\/h3>\n<p>Not only are you competing with other agents, you\u2019re also competing with all of the other things that take prospects\u2019 time and attention away from buying or selling. So find your own unique way to stand out. Maybe for you it\u2019s your personality, a catchphrase, a resource you provide, or a personal connection you share.<\/p>\n<p>But remember: Ultimately, the call isn\u2019t about you. It\u2019s about helping the prospect. So as you\u2019re capturing their attention, be careful not to push them aside. Always help your prospects draw a clear connection between what you do and how (exactly) that benefits them.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">8. Give Them the Next Steps<\/h3>\n<p>After the call is over, they should know what\u2019s going to happen next. End by scheduling a meeting, for example, or nailing down the best time for a follow-up call.<\/p>\n<p>Is there a specific action you want them to take after the call? Tell them plainly. Depending on the situation, you might have one specific call to action (e.g., \u201cTake a look at the listings on my website,\u201d or \u201cCheck out this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/blog\/what-is-a-cma-in-real-estate\/\">CMA<\/a> and let me know what you think\u201d).<\/p>\n<p>Or maybe the next step is something you will do (e.g., \u201cI\u2019m going to shoot you an email that walks you through the buying process\u2026,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ll give you a call on Wednesday\u2026\u201d).<\/p>\n<p>In any case, don\u2019t end the call without providing clarity about who is doing what when.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Speaking of next steps\u2026<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Cold calling is just one way you can get more listings.
