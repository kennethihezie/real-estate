So it ends up being just another task on their long list of obligations.<\/p>\n<p>But it can be (should be!) much more than that. This kind of analysis is extremely valuable, especially in today\u2019s fast-moving, ever-changing real estate market. It\u2019s one of the most important things separating real estate agents from Zillow.<\/p>\n<p>Get ready to learn everything you need to know about performing comparative market analyses that benefit leads, clients, and agents alike, because this article walks you through how to do a CMA in four simple steps.<\/p>\n<p>But before we get into the nitty gritty, let\u2019s take a step back to consider the purpose. Why is a CMA in real estate even necessary?<\/p>\n<p>Knowing how to create a CMA from start to finish is important. But having a clear understanding of the \u201cwhy\u201d is what will give you a significant boost over your competitors.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">How a CMA Benefits <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Consumers<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The benefit of a CMA for sellers (or potential sellers) is obvious. By comparing their home to similar homes that either just sold or are under contract, <strong>they can get a better idea of what their home is currently worth<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>But a CMA can also be a valuable point of reference for <em>buyers<\/em>.<\/strong> They don\u2019t want to make an offer that\u2019s too low, and they don\u2019t want to overpay. A CMA helps them avoid both risks. It helps them size up their competition (by showing them what other buyers may be willing to pay for the home they\u2019re interested in) while also giving them a clear boundary that shows how high is too high.<\/p>\n<p>In any case, what consumers of all kinds are looking for is objectivity. They want to know without a doubt that a home\u2019s value is derived from a valid, data-driven process. Why? Because it <strong>provides a sense of comfort<\/strong> during what is often a stressful time and it <strong>gives them confidence<\/strong> to make a move (pun intended).<\/p>\n<p>The upcoming four-step process for creating a CMA in real estate will offer all of the aforementioned consumer-facing benefits.<\/p>\n<p>But a CMA also benefits you as the agent. Here\u2019s how.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">How a CMA Benefits <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Real Estate Agents<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s start with the basics.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A CMA is a great way to prove your value and establish credibility.<\/strong> By showing not only facts and figures but also your interpretation, insights, and conclusions based on the data, you\u2019re essentially saying, \u201cI\u2019m the local expert, I\u2019ve put in the hard work to understand this market at a granular level, and I\u2019m bringing a kind of value that no other agent can provide.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>A CMA gives you the confidence you need to negotiate like a top-producer.<\/strong> You can rest on the power of objectivity instead of the weakness of personal opinion. It\u2019s difficult to dismiss an offer or counter a price that\u2019s supported with good data.<\/p>\n<p>But did you know that a CMA can also be a powerful marketing tool?<\/p>\n<p><strong>For example, consider sending prospects a CMA as part of your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/blog\/real-estate-direct-mail\/\">direct mail marketing<\/a> strategy.<\/strong> Homeowners are rarely in touch with local market trends, despite what they might think. Few could tell you the current value of their home, and chances are, they\u2019d be shocked to know how much the homes in their neighborhoods are currently selling for.<\/p>\n<p>Leveraging a real estate CMA (even a lightweight CMA in a postcard, brochure-style pamphlet, or an email) can help prospects think more seriously about taking the next step. It could be that simply presenting that kind of information to a prospect \u2013 at a time when no other agent would \u2013 is all it takes to turn them into a lead, and eventually into a client.<\/p>\n<p>By the way, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/products\/professional-for-agents\/\">you can easily create useful mini CMAs for your leads and clients with Market Leader Pro<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">How To Do a CMA (for Sellers)<\/h2>\n<p>First, a caveat. There\u2019s no such thing as a one-size-fits-all process for making a CMA in real estate. The exact procedures will differ each time, depending on where you are, who it\u2019s for, and why you\u2019re doing it.<\/p>\n<p>So while the four-step process outlined below is a kind of \u201chow-to guide,\u201d it can\u2019t possibly take every situation into account. Too many factors and variables are involved, because all prospects, leads, clients, neighborhoods, homes, and listings are different.<\/p>\n<p>For example, how you do a CMA for a standard ranch-style home in rural America is going to look very different than what you\u2019d do for a inner-city luxury property in Toronto. And the process you\u2019d go through to create a generalized direct mail piece will look different than it would if you were putting a report together for a buyer.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless, it\u2019s helpful to familiarize yourself with the basic methodology that this step-by-step guide outlines so you can tailor it to the needs at hand.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">The Checklist<\/h3>\n<p>Every standard CMA in real estate (for a seller) will include the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Property details (Step 1)<\/li>\n<li>Comps (Step 2)<\/li>\n<li>Pricing recommendations (Step 3)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">Step 1: Learn About the Home<\/h3>\n<p>In the steps that follow, you\u2019re going to find comparable listings (or \u201ccomps\u201d). To do that, you first need to learn everything you can about the home so you\u2019ll know how to draw accurate comparisons.<\/p>\n<p>Keep in mind that you\u2019re doing more than just fact-collecting. You\u2019re also learning about the home\u2019s \u201cstory,\u201d so to speak: the history of the home, the neighborhood, and the surrounding area.<\/p>\n<p>The more research you do here, the more accurate the CMA will be. But here are the essential pieces of information you\u2019ll need to collect:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Location<\/li>\n<li>Size (square footage)<\/li>\n<li>Year built<\/li>\n<li>Number of beds and baths<\/li>\n<li>Condition (e.g., Is it new-build? Have there been any significant renovations?)<\/li>\n<li>Amenities, customizations, and special features<\/li>\n<li>Property tax information<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You can draw from many different sources as you conduct your research, including the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The homeowner, of course<\/li>\n<li>MLS data<\/li>\n<li>Previous listing data (i.e., list price, sold price, days on the market, etc.)<\/li>\n<li>The NAR\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nar.realtor\/realtors-property-resource-rpr\">Realtors Property Resource<\/a> (RPR)<\/li>\n<li>Tax records<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">Step 2: Compile a List of Comps<\/h3>\n<p>Now that you know about the home, you know how to compare it to other homes in the area. Here are some best practices.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Be smart about how you choose your comps.<\/strong> Comparables (i.e., \u201ccomps\u201d) are listings (both sold and active) that are very similar to the property you\u2019re working with. Get as close as you can to finding identical matches, especially in terms of their location, square footage, lot size, layout, style, and condition.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Compile a strong list.<\/strong> Include enough properties on your list to determine an average and suggest a reasonable range of prices. But don\u2019t make it so long that you and your client get bogged down with too much information.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Stick with the here-and-now.<\/strong> Remember, the key to making a successful CMA in real estate is to work with accurate, reliable, and relevant data. There\u2019s no point in comparing the home in question to a listing that sold three years ago, or even one year ago, for that matter. You and your client need to know what similar homes are selling for now. So stay current, within, say, the past three months. And in this market, you definitely shouldn\u2019t dig back farther than six months.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Look at sold prices and active listings.<\/strong> By looking at homes that have sold recently and listings that are currently active, you\u2019ll get an even keener sense of the local market\u2019s condition. Be sure to pay close attention to comparable listings that are currently under contract because that will give you insight into the difference between asking price and sold price. It\u2019s those kinds of nuances that will both impress your clients and give you the competitive edge you need to become the local expert.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">Step 3: Set Your Pricing Recommendations<\/h3>\n<p>At this point you\u2019ll be equipped with all of the information you need to provide sound guidance for your clients.<\/p>\n<p>Give them a range of three numbers to consider \u2013 one that\u2019s on the conservative side, one that\u2019s on the aggressive side, and one that\u2019s in the middle.<\/p>\n<p>Base your pricing recommendations on three factors:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your list of comps<\/li>\n<li>The home\u2019s condition and appeal (including any adjustments that need to be made to account for customizations, amenities, renovations, etc.)<\/li>\n<li>Anticipation of where the market seems to be headed<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">Step 4: Create and Deliver Your CMA<\/h3>\n<p>There are many formatting options and ways you could present your CMA report to your clients. For you, that might look like a PowerPoint presentation, a simple set of tables and charts, or even a quick email with a bulleted outline.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s no right or wrong here. But as we saw in the checklist above, be sure to include at least a summary of the property details, your list of comps, and your pricing recommendations. Make it easy for them to understand your process and how you arrived at your conclusions. Not only does this show the objectivity of your report, but it also puts your leads and clients at ease in case they\u2019re disappointed by numbers they didn\u2019t expect.<\/p>\n<p>However you go about delivering and presenting your CMA, keep in mind that you\u2019re bringing value, proving your worth, and demonstrating your expertise.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">How to Send a Quick CMA With Market Leader Pro<\/h2>\n<p>When you get a new seller lead through Market Leader\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/learn.marketleader.com\/display\/learning\/HouseValues+Lead+Experience\">HouseValues<\/a> leads product, you can send them a quick, mini CMA through our Marketing Center.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It\u2019s pre-formatted and pre-populated with customizable text.<\/li>\n<li>It can even include current active listings from the MLS and sold comparables to support the price range you determine.<\/li>\n<li>You can create your CMA as an email or printable document.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/products\/professional-for-agents\/\">Learn more about Market Leader Pro, the single-solution product for generating more leads and turning them into lifelong clients.<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What is a CMA in real estate? \u201cCMA\u201d stands for comparative market analysis, and it refers to the process of estimating a property\u2019s value, based on the listing prices and sold prices of similar homes nearby and other data related to the local market.
