After all, if you work very hard, and if you are very efficient, you will be surprised by how much you increase your chances of being lucky.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some tips for doing both.<\/p>\n<h2>Schedule Prospecting First<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright  wp-image-40151\" title=\"productive real estate agent\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/productive-real-estate-agent-300x199.jpg\" alt=\"productivity principles for real estate agents\" width=\"270\" height=\"179\" \/>Prospecting is the appointment on your calendar for your business. It\u2019s your business\u2019s \u2018me\u2019 time, and it\u2019s the most important time you can schedule. If you plan to sit for 90 minutes and do nothing but cold call every Monday through Thursday, then put it on your calendar.\u00a0 You can move that time around, maybe, but make sure you aren\u2019t done for the day until you\u2019ve made those calls.<\/p>\n<p>Too many agents make the mistake of prospecting when they have nothing else to do. That makes prospecting the last thing they do every day, when all the other options are out. Prospecting is market development, and it should be your <em>first <\/em>priority, not your last.<\/p>\n<h2>Work to Objective, Not to Time<\/h2>\n<p>If your objective is to have 10 conversations with new prospects, do that. If you want to make 100 calls, then do that. Either way, it\u2019s better than saying \u201cI am going to make phone calls for two hours.\u201d Why? Because most people won\u2019t make the calls. They will shuffle papers, look at the clock, fiddle with their contact list, muck about with spreadsheets \u2013 anything but make the calls. That\u2019s no good. You have to be on the phone, talking to people, or you\u2019re missing the point.<\/p>\n<h2>Have a Business Plan<\/h2>\n<p>As the saying goes, those who fail to plan are planning to fail. Your business plan is vital. When everything is vague, when you feel like success is eluding you at every step, when you feel unmotivated and when you are overwhelmed with the vast number of things you have to accomplish as an agent, your business plan gives you a track to run on.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 16px; color: #19398a;\">More business plan tips from Market Leader:<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Watch this webinar recording to learn how to understand your strengths and weaknesses, find what your focus area should be, and how to create checklists for lead generation, lead engagement, marketing and branding.<\/p>\n<div class=\"wistia_responsive_padding\" style=\"padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;\">\n<div class=\"wistia_responsive_wrapper\" style=\"height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"\/\/fast.wistia.net\/embed\/iframe\/j5syt6zcn7?videoFoam=true\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" class=\"wistia_embed\" name=\"wistia_embed\" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><script src=\"\/\/fast.wistia.net\/assets\/external\/E-v1.js\" async><\/script><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2>Eliminate Distractions<\/h2>\n<p>Yes, Facebook is still one of them. I don\u2019t care what\u2019s said about the importance of social media, if you\u2019re scrolling through your own timeline and not speaking substantially with someone about buying, selling or renting real estate, it\u2019s a distraction. (I know because I\u2019m guilty as sin!)<\/p>\n<p>Some tips for eliminating distractions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Close the door to your home office.<\/li>\n<li>Working on something on the computer? Use the full screen option until you\u2019re done.<\/li>\n<li>Have a to-do list. In writing. You can use a program like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.evernote.com\/\">Evernote,<\/a> or you can just keep a notebook. Do what works for you.<\/li>\n<li>Prioritize each task with an A, B or C. The A\u2019s get done first. And they can\u2019t all be A\u2019s! If you divide your tasks into A\u2019s, B\u2019s and C\u2019s, it will force you to prioritize.<\/li>\n<li>Check email at set times during the day. For example, not before noon!<\/li>\n<li>Use a time management program like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yast.com\/\">Yast.<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Don\u2019t use too many different productivity tools. If you try to use too many, you will not use any of them well.<\/li>\n<li>Don\u2019t sit at a desk next to another real estate agent at your office. You can\u2019t sell to each other!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Master the Art of Delegation<\/h2>\n<p>This is for agents who have assistants or support staff. But to delegate well, you have to plan to do that, and plan to follow up on those delegated tasks.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t have your own assistant? You can work with other agents to share one, or you can engage a service like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zirtual.com\/\">Zirtual<\/a>, which provides virtual digital assistants who can help you with some basic tasks like scheduling, online research, database entry, direct mailing, email management, Twitter updates and social media interactions, etc.<\/p>\n<p>For example, you could go to a networking event, grab a bunch of business cards, scan them and send them off to a virtual assistant (VA), who will enter them into your database or contact management system. You can do the same thing with receipts, expenses and bookkeeping tasks as well. (Though I use <a href=\"http:\/\/www.expensify.com\/\">Expensify<\/a> to capture receipts and expenses.)<\/p>\n<p>Depending on your VA\u2019s skill set, you can also have them clean up and format your presentations, marketing materials, and so forth. But before you go crazy working with assistants, make sure that both you and the assistant understand what unlicensed assistants can and can\u2019t do in your jurisdiction.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are three ingredients to productivity: Luck, which you can\u2019t control, and activity and efficiency, which you can.
