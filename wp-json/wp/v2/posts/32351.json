Imagine selling lakefront homes and waterfront condos and you\u2019ll have an idea of what her life is currently like.<\/p>\n<p>Tammy Scheiter is a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yourlaketeam.com\/\">RE\/MAX agent<\/a> in a town where she\u2019s spent her entire life. \u201cI grew up living on the Lake of the Ozarks,\u201d she begins. \u201cMy father was an excavator but we had a resort when I was younger. I was answering the phone and taking reservations when I was 10 and 11 years old, so I think that\u2019s where the customer service thing came from.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That \u201ccustomer service thing\u201d is something Scheiter excels at. Anyone that\u2019s grown up in a resort town understands that tourists are both a blessing and a curse. Scheiter prefers to concentrate on the former. \u201cWe appreciated tourists \u2013 that\u2019s how we all made our living, was off the tourists,\u201d she explains. \u201cEverything we had came directly or indirectly from tourists.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Before Real Estate<\/h2>\n<p>Scheiter held a variety of jobs before finally settling in the real estate industry. She worked on a gas dock, in restaurants, in banking and as a dental assistant. It was while working in the dental field, at the age of 30, that she was diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer. Not one to dwell on anything unpleasant, she sums up the experience by telling us, \u201cFifteen years later and I\u2019m still here.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>The Big Decision<\/h2>\n<p>When she was well enough to work, Scheiter found herself working at a local radio station, selling time. While straight commission sales always scared her, this job paid a small salary plus commission, so she feels it was the ideal job to get her gradually accustomed to not relying completely on a salary.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI was getting more and more comfortable with that commission structure,\u201d she recalls. By 2005 she was comfortable enough to make a break from the salaried world and took on real estate full time.<\/p>\n<h2>Challenges at the 10-Year Mark<\/h2>\n<p>Scheiter will celebrate a decade in the industry next year, and we were curious to know what kind of challenges she faces at this point in her career.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a really tough year,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really tough market. This year I think I\u2019ve shown more property than in any year I\u2019ve been in real estate, and I have less to show for it. There\u2019s a big discord between buyers and sellers right now and our inventory is really down. We\u2019ve really had to change the dialog and how we present what\u2019s in our market,\u201d Sheiter concluded.<\/p>\n<h2>The Second-Home Niche<\/h2>\n<p>Scheiter estimates that 70 percent of her clients are second-home buyers. To reach these clients she relies heavily on the Internet. \u201cWe do a little bit of print, but 98 percent of our buyers start on the Internet, so we have to have a presence there. You can\u2019t just be out there on the Internet, though, you also have to look good on the Internet,\u201d she suggests.<\/p>\n<h2>Scheiter and Market Leader<\/h2>\n<p>We\u2019re always curious how agents learn about Market Leader products, so we asked Scheiter what led her to us.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI started looking for some different lead generating systems,\u201d she recalls. She found Market Leader during her research, and after speaking with a representative she was sold.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt was a significant investment, but it wasn\u2019t something that, if it didn\u2019t work, it would break me, so I signed up for six months,\u201d she explained. \u201cThen, all of a sudden, I had three or four transactions that closed just before the six months was up. I think it generated me 30 or 40 thousand dollars. So I kept with it, because it obviously works,\u201d she said, laughing.<\/p>\n<p>We asked Scheiter what she likes best about her Market Leader products. \u201cAll the automatic things that go out are really kind of cool because people tell me I\u2019ve been sending them stuff,\u201d she said. \u201cThe system sent them, but people thought it was me,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cIt gives me a different rapport on the first phone call. People feel like they know me a little and are more comfortable. You\u2019re already on that level because of what the system is sending out,\u201d Scheiter concludes.<\/p>\n<h2>The Love of Real Estate<\/h2>\n<p>Scheiter\u2019s favorite part of going to work every day is showing houses. More important, she says, are her clients\u2019 reactions when they find that just-right house. \u201cI love it when I open the door and I know they\u2019ve found <em>that<\/em> house \u2013 just seeing them light up is everything.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Imagine growing up in a resort area where life is centered on a 55,000-acre lake and you\u2019ll get an idea of Tammy Scheiter\u2019s childhood.
