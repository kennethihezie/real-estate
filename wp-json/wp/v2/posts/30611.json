Suppose you were showing him rural property with no doctor and no hospitals nearby?<\/p>\n<p>Yes, it\u2019s a scary thought and it\u2019s something that actually happened to agent <a href=\"http:\/\/NEFloridaHomes4Sale.com\">Scott Hum<\/a> with RE\/MAX Specialists in Jacksonville, Fla. Thankfully, the client was experiencing an anxiety attack, Hum says.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHe took a few deep breaths and everything was fine. But that worried me, so I went ahead and took an EMT class,\u201d he explains. Now he\u2019s certified and knows exactly what to do should he ever find himself in the situation again.<\/p>\n<p>Hum grew up in Lincoln, a small town in central Illinois, and remained there for the first 30 years of his life. The fact that he got to turn the air conditioning on in January was the deciding factor in moving from chilly Illinois to Florida. \u201cI\u2019ve lived here for 10 years and never once had to use an ice scraper,\u201d he said, laughing.<\/p>\n<p>Prior to real estate, Hum worked in the automotive industry, something he dreamed of as a child. <strong>\u201c<\/strong>I worked for automobile dealerships, for General Motors most of the time,\u201d he explained. \u201cI was a service technician, a shop foreman and then a service manager.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>From Cars to Houses<\/h2>\n<p>After almost two decades in the auto industry, the idea to switch to a real estate career came gradually. \u201cTwo of my close friends that I worked with in the automotive business decided that they were going to quit what they were doing and get into real estate,\u201d Hum recalled.<\/p>\n<p>He watched his friends\u2019 progress and liked what he saw. \u201cI saw how much more flexibility they had and how their quality of life had changed since they got out of the automotive industry.\u201d In 2002, Hum used his two week vacation from his job to study and sit for his real estate licensing exam. He left the automotive industry and went into real estate full time.<\/p>\n<p>The best advice he was given as a rookie?<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s really kind of corny, but when I first started the couple that mentored me gave me a little girl\u2019s mirror,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>They told him he had to look at it whenever he made calls. \u201cWhen you\u2019re looking in a little girl\u2019s pink mirror, it\u2019s hard not to smile.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>When you\u2019re first starting in the business, you\u2019re so nervous you just blurt out the stuff you know you\u2019re supposed to say. When you\u2019re smiling, though, it comes out a lot better.<\/p>\n<h2>Marketing<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>We were curious about how Hum markets himself and his business at the 12-year mark in the industry. \u201cOver 12 years, I\u2019ve tried everything,\u201d he explains. \u201cRight now I use a lot of word of mouth and I have a couple different websites. My Market Leader site has been the best for me so far. I think that 90 percent of people looking for houses are starting on the Internet, and you have to have a presence on the Internet and be able to reach out to them,\u201d he concludes.<\/p>\n<p>Remaining in touch with past clients is important to him, and his efforts pay off. Hum estimates that at least 65 percent of his business comes from repeat business and referrals.<\/p>\n<h2>So, Why Market Leader?<\/h2>\n<p>We\u2019re always interested in what brings our clients and our products together, so we asked Hum how he was introduced to Market Leader.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI had heard a presentation from another RE\/MAX agent about how good her results were with the products,\u201d he begins. \u201cI needed something different, and I\u2019d been on other company\u2019s websites and just couldn\u2019t find what I needed.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMarket Leader has just been phenomenal for me,\u201d Hum continues. \u201cRight off the bat I started getting warm leads. Within the first month I had customers that actually answered the phone and wanted to buy and had real email addresses.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWithin two months I had two houses under contract &#8211; just off of my Market Leader website,\u201d Hum said. \u201cIn less than six months with Market Leader I have closed five transactions and about $800,000 of real estate. My Market Leader website has paid for itself three times over,\u201d he concludes.<\/p>\n<p>Hum also credits Market Leader webinars with giving him the training that other companies don\u2019t provide. \u201cThe company has given me the training and the tools for the first time, to know what I&#8217;m doing with the website and what to say to new prospects on the phone. My website brings them to me, but it&#8217;s my job to keep them coming back,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<h2>The Future<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Hum is in love with the real estate industry &#8211; \u201ceverything about it,\u201d he claims. \u201cI would do this for free if my wife would let me,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cI love what I do. I do not even think about the commission until the day of closing, and that is just to make sure all the numbers add up.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is one of those businesses that I feel I can do as long as they keep giving me a driver\u2019s license. I just turned 50 and I see myself doing this for another couple of decades.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What would you do if you had a client in your car who suddenly complained of chest pains?
