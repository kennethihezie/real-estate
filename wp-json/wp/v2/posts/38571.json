The Real Deal on Real Estate Designations"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>There are a couple of things sure to fire up a group of real estate agents. For example, tell them that FSBOs <em>can<\/em> sell homes on their own, and can maybe even make top dollar (we <em>know<\/em> that isn\u2019t true).

That alphabet string after your name on a business card doesn\u2019t impress anyone, either. Well, at least according to a consumer panel at a Hear It Direct conference.<\/p>\n<p>If that is true, and since these real estate designations cost valuable time and money, what reason would an agent have to pursue them? Believe it or not, impressing clients isn\u2019t the only reason to become certified or designated. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the \u201cwhys\u201d behind the pursuit.<\/p>\n<h2>Brushing Up for Business Building<\/h2>\n<p>Going back over the list of Certified Residential Specialist (CRS) courses required for that designation, you\u2019ll find that most of them do hold value \u2013 for agents. Refresher courses on keeping in touch with your sphere, a class on social media or listing presentations are all worthwhile ways to help agents build their businesses or take them to the next level.<\/p>\n<p>Elective classes in the Accredited Buyer\u2019s Representative (ABR\u00ae) program include Resort and Second Home-Markets, HAFA Short Sales, and a class on foreclosures, among others.<\/p>\n<p>The educational possibilities are almost endless once you start looking into various real estate designations and certifications. New agents, or agents trying to learn new tricks or build career momentum, place a high value on these courses.<\/p>\n<h2>A Referral Gold Mine<\/h2>\n<p>For many designations, the process first requires membership in the sponsoring organization. Most of the programs come with a referral network, and agents are typically diligent in referring clients to others within the network.<\/p>\n<p>San Diego agent George Alexiou obtained the e-PRO\u00ae designation, and two months later he took a referral from a Virginia agent that led to a $14,000 commission. \u201cDo I like the networking part of being an e-PRO\u00ae? You bet I LOVE it,\u201d Alexiou wrote in a Real Estate Webmasters forum.<\/p>\n<p>It may be a smart investment of both time and money to earn a designation if it leads to a pipeline of lucrative referrals. However, unless you\u2019re learning something that particularly qualifies you as an expert, don\u2019t position yourself as such. That is dishonest and may end up diluting your credibility.<\/p>\n<h2>How to Add Value to a Designation<\/h2>\n<p>Obviously, some certificates and designations do add value to a real estate consumer\u2019s experience, but it\u2019s really up to <em>you <\/em>to add value to your designation.<\/p>\n<p>Within the course offerings for most designations, you\u2019ll likely find several courses that teach skills that will actually benefit the client. An agent that holds the ABR\u00ae designation, for instance, can opt to take Effective Negotiating for Real Estate Professionals as an elective, and learn a skill of high value to home-buying clients.<\/p>\n<p>Another example is Market Leader\u2019s Internet Marketing Specialist Designation (IMSD) which teaches agents how to market themselves online. On the surface, it appears to be self-serving. The value for the consumer, however, is that the knowledge gained can be applied to all forms of Internet marketing \u2013 including marketing for their listings.<\/p>\n<p align=\"center\">&#8212;<\/p>\n<p>While someone with an MD or MBA after their name doesn\u2019t need to explain what those letters mean to potential clients, real estate agents do. So slow down, take the time to explain not only what the letters stand for, but the time and effort required to be able to use them, and exactly how the designation will benefit the client.<\/p>\n<p>Explanations and communication build trust \u2013 and trust builds business.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are a couple of things sure to fire up a group of real estate agents.
