the tone of this year&#8217;s event was decidedly more positive than last year&#8217;s.\u00a0 While I don&#8217;t think many leaders are expecting a robust market any time soon, most feel that the worst is behind us.\u00a0 Brokerage companies see the current environment as an opportunity differentiate themselves and seem more willing to invest (albeit cautiously) to take market share.<\/p>\n<p>\u00b7 Network Level Innovation &#8211; There was an interesting panel featuring the leaders of the leading real estate franchisors and networks.\u00a0 I heard good commentary from all of the participants but was particularly engaged by Pam O&#8217;Connor, CEO of The Leading Real Estate Companies of the World, and Mark Willis, CEO of Keller Williams.\u00a0 Both leaders clearly articulated the ways in which they differentiate what they do from other franchise organizations.\u00a0\u00a0 It&#8217;s easy to see why both companies have continued to be successful in even the most challenging of environments.<\/p>\n<p>\u00b7 Lead Generation &#8211; More and more attention continues to be paid to lead generation, and all aspects of the who, what, where, and how to be successful at it.\u00a0 In the &#8220;boom&#8221;, many companies seemed to take a \u2018who needs it&#8217; approach to the space, but now it&#8217;s clear that the brokers and the networks know they need to create compelling lead generation strategies if they are going to effectively compete for consumers and for agents.<\/p>\n<p>There were many other excellent talks as well.\u00a0 Steve Murray, CEO of Real Trends and host of the event, as always, provided valuable insights about where Real Trends sees the market heading over the next few years.\u00a0 This insight is a big part of why so many leaders make their way to the event every year.\u00a0 Rich Barton, CEO of Zillow, did a great job of engaging the audience with his take on what&#8217;s to come, and the important role that the iPad and technologies like it will play in the future.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"&quot;float: right;

Can I interest you in an online real estate tennis match?\u00a0 Perhaps we could even make it interesting &#8211; for charity, of course.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I spent a few days in Dallas this week for the 2010 Gathering of Eagles, a conference for the nation&#8217;s largest real estate brokerage companies put on by Real Trends each year.\u00a0 While our industry has more conferences that most of us can attend, I always find the Gathering to be an excellent event and [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":9,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_et_pb_use_builder":"","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":""},"categories":[27,36],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/360"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/9"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=360"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/360\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=360"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=360"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=360"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
