It\u2019s time to embrace the e-signature for real estate contracts.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">The History of E-Signature Technology<\/h2>\n<p>E-signatures are not exactly new. The first completely paperless house sale, using only electronic signatures, took place decades ago, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/realestate\/real-estate-in-the-digital-age-the-time-has-come\/2012\/08\/16\/8e777032-e64c-11e1-8741-940e3f6dbf48_story.html\">on July 25, 2000.<\/a> Both the sale and financing of a home were involved, and the entire transaction took five minutes to record.<\/p>\n<p>Some industry studies are showing that using digital signatures on documents can result in turnaround-time improvements of <a href=\"https:\/\/s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com\/ombudcontent\/research\/Ombud+Open+Research+-+eSignature+Solutions_June_2013.pdf\">as much as 80 percent<\/a>. Yet many agents, sales support staff, and other real estate professionals are still stuck in the dark ages, almost 15 years later.<\/p>\n<p>We have a system where technology-challenged bureaucrats\u2014including ones who happen to own brokerage companies\u2014still have people standing in line for notary stamps and burning gas to track down that last signature.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">Real Estate\u2019s Slow Shift to Digital<\/h2>\n<p>Yes, the industry is hidebound, in part because government and quasi-government agencies have been slow to adapt. The legal framework recognizing e-signatures as legally binding was set in 2000 with the federal <a href=\"http:\/\/www.law.cornell.edu\/uscode\/text\/15\/chapter-96\">Electronic Signatures In Global and National Commerce Act<\/a>. (E-SIGN\u2026 Get it?) But Fannie Mae didn\u2019t begin accepting e-signatures on REO offers until 2012. Bank of America also dragged its feet until 2012, when it finally began accepting e-signatures on pre-approved short-sale documents.<\/p>\n<p>County governments are dragging, too. Apparently still struggling with the task of shoveling coal into the boiler rooms powering their CPUs, only about a third of Florida counties have adopted some level of electronic recordings, according to reporting from the Washington Post.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">How E-Signatures Work for Real Estate Agents<\/h2>\n<p>E-signature technology, when fully embraced at the government and broker level, allows clients to easily complete required purchase, sales and financing documents from their computers. The technology exists for tablets and smartphones as well.<\/p>\n<p>The agent simply brings up the document, or package of documents, enters the client\u2019s email address, and clicks \u201csend.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The client gets an email notice, and either sees the document as a PDF with the signature areas flagged, or a software program guides the client step-by-step through each signature and initial. The program can flag any missed signatures or initials. When done, the client simply hits \u201csend,\u201d and the completed document or documents is automatically sent back to the agent.<\/p>\n<p>So if the client has access to email, there\u2019s no need to lick stamps, fill out FedEx envelopes, or drive all over creation pleading for him to fill in that one missed initial.<\/p>\n<p>Widely available software packages also support automatic notification of all parties when additional signatures are secured. They can even integrate the e-signature program with standard workflow programs \u2013 minimizing potential for errors and giving management the opportunity to monitor in-progress documents as they move to completion.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps most importantly, the better programs out there provide PIN number access and independent, third-party verification of IP numbers to create an audit trail for every signature and to verify the signer\u2019s identity. Finally, document storage and on-demand retrieval is relatively easy and cheap.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pro-Tip:<\/strong> It won\u2019t do you much good to have a stack of digitally-signed documents, only to find out a lender won\u2019t accept them. Do your homework and ensure that upstream lenders and other stakeholders and transaction participants support e-signatures.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">Not All Real Estate E-Signature Vendors Are Alike<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s one thing to allow a user to \u201cpaste\u201d a crude signature on a document. But maintaining a digital chain of custody, with verification steps along the way to ensure that the validity of any signature can withstand a vigorous challenge in court, is quite another. So is providing the security of sensitive information and compliance with federal and state regulatory bodies.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a simple test: Try using a digital signature on whatever document you like. Once it\u2019s signed, can you now alter the document? If you can, so can anyone else. That sort of protocol won\u2019t be much good for big dollar contracts, such as real estate deals. Not all vendors support mobile devices like tablets and smartphones, either.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">Top Real Estate E-Signature Options for Agents<\/h2>\n<h3>Adobe EchoSign<\/h3>\n<p>EchoSign, a property of Adobe, inked a deal with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.planetre.com\/index.html\">PlanetRE<\/a> to field an e-signature solution as part of a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.planetre.com\/Transact.html\">transaction management suite.<\/a> The PlanetRE program will support these features:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Automatic logging of signatures<\/li>\n<li>Alerts when a client views and\/or signs a document<\/li>\n<li>Secure document sharing<\/li>\n<li>Compatibility with other e-signature vendors such as DocuSign and CIC<\/li>\n<li>Notes feature to facilitate auditor\/agent communication<\/li>\n<li>Branded CDs<\/li>\n<li>Integrated email<\/li>\n<li>iPad and iPhone support, among other devices<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">Constellation1 eSign<\/h3>\n<p>Constellation1 eSign offers a simple, user-friendly interface, and allows users to access documents from any device at any time.
