It provides space for you to calculate your personal living expenses and all of your various business expenses all in one place.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">Set Your Real Estate Business Goals<\/h2>\n<p>Start by <strong>identifying your average commission per transaction<\/strong>. Multiply the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.realtor.com\/research\/market-trends\/\">median listing price in your area<\/a> by your commission percentage rate.<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve calculated your expenses and you\u2019ve figured out roughly how much you\u2019ll bring in from each transaction, you\u2019ll be informed enough to establish an <strong>attainable income goal for 2023<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>From there you can determine how many transactions you\u2019ll need for the year.<\/p>\n<p>The Formula: A \u00f7 B = C<\/p>\n<p>A.

Or maybe you have a plan, but it\u2019s not working.<\/p>\n<p>Either way, you\u2019ll benefit from learning how to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/blog\/real-estate-marketing-plan\/\">craft a well-developed real estate marketing plan<\/a> that\u2019s specifically designed to help you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/products\/real-estate-leads\/\">generate more leads<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a quick outline sketch of what that would look like in practical terms.<\/p>\n<ul class=\"BlogUL\">\n<li class=\"BlogLI\"><strong>Build your brand.<\/strong> Establish a brand identity that includes a mission statement, vision statement, and a value proposition.<\/li>\n<li class=\"BlogLI\"><strong>Define your target market.<\/strong> You can\u2019t be everything to everyone. If you try, your brand will end up blending in instead of standing out. So take the time to identify who fits within your audience.<\/li>\n<li class=\"BlogLI\"><strong>Collect data.<\/strong> When you\u2019re armed with statistics, analytics, and insights, you\u2019re better able to set goals, track progress, and make your success repeatable. Without data, your marketing efforts are more likely to be a complete gamble, if not a guessing game.<\/li>\n<li class=\"BlogLI\"><strong>Get marketing automation tools.<\/strong> With <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/products\/professional-for-agents\/\">Market Leader Professional<\/a>, for example, you get a customizable, lead-generating website and a fully integrated CRM.

It can be as easy as creating a basic table in your favorite word processor or spreadsheet software, writing down all of your goals in the left column, and using the rest of the columns to note your performance each month (or week).<\/p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #41464D; color: #ffffff; border-radius: 15px; padding: 30px 30px 20px 30px; margin: 20px 0px;\">\n<h2 id=\"download\" class=\"BlogH2\" style=\"color: #ffffff !important; margin-top: 0px !important;\">Get Your 2023 Real Estate Business Plan Today!<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/storage.pardot.com\/42972\/1668559823ZZuSMO0m\/2023_Real_Estate_Business_Plan_Cover_v2.png\" alt=\"Get this guide to learn real estate marketing ideas which will take your business to the next level in 2023!\" width=\"350\" height=\"380\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-61708\" style=\"margin-left: 0px !important;\" \/>Planning is the first step in getting more leads and increasing your commission income.
