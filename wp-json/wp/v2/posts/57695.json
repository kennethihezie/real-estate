They won\u2019t help you to be a better negotiator, to market homes or to efficiently and successfully work with buyers.<\/p>\n<p>That education is up to you to pursue. Or, you can choose not to bone up on the truly important stuff and be a mediocre player in your chosen profession.<\/p>\n<h2>Master marketing.<\/h2>\n<p>Real estate schools and real estate brokers aren\u2019t known for teaching agents how to market homes. It\u2019s why there are so many \u201clist and pray\u201d listing agents out there and why so many homes languish in buyers\u2019 markets.<\/p>\n<p>Sure, you can follow the crowd, copying what other listing agents are doing. But if what they\u2019re doing isn\u2019t working for them, what makes you think it will work for you?<\/p>\n<p>Then, there\u2019s your business marketing. If you are early in your career, learning how to market yourself and your services is paramount to not only making a living but building a referral base to keep you going down the line.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re past the rookie stuff, how are you differentiating yourself from the rest of the agents in town?<\/p>\n<p>Marketing is one of the biggest holes in real estate training. And, when the day is consumed with generating and following up on real estate leads and servicing existing clients, who has time to fill that hole?<\/p>\n<p>But, fill it you must, and, with just a few hours a week you can learn how to become a better marketer and move away from the pack of the more complacent agents in town.<\/p>\n<p>The Digital Marketing Institute offers marketing courses with certificates upon completion. If I were interviewing listing agents, the Certified Digital Marketing Specialist is going to impress far more than the agents with those NAR designation abbreviations trailing their names.<\/p>\n<p>Download the brochure at <a href=\"https:\/\/digitalmarketinginstitute.com\/students\/courses\/professional-certificate-in-digital-marketing-usa\">DigitalMarketingInstitute.com<\/a>.

Just a thought, but if you\u2019re struggling to learn different aspects to running your business, a coach may just be the answer.<\/p>\n<p>We recently covered the whole <a href=\"\/blog\/why-every-agent-should-get-real-estate-coaching\/\">real estate coach thing, in detail.<\/a>\u00a0In a nutshell, a coach can help you improve various aspects of your business and how to attract clients.<\/p>\n<p>Some real estate coaches are generalists, such as the brilliant <a href=\"https:\/\/goborino.com\/\">Borino<\/a>, while others, like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.floydwickman.com\/\">Floyd Wickman<\/a>, specialize in just a few aspects of the real estate business.<\/p>\n<p>Then, there are the different ways you can receive your coaching. <a href=\"https:\/\/craigproctor.com\/\">Craig Proctor<\/a>, for instance, offers webinars, one-on-one coaching and more. Many coaches offer phone support.<\/p>\n<p>All Market Leader customers have access to the <a href=\"\/resources\/million-dollar-pipeline-program\/\">Million Dollar Pipeline Program<\/a>, an exclusive real estate coaching program that provides tools and techniques to exceed transaction goals and scale your business with on-demand webinars, scripts, templates, and a closed Facebook group with access to top-performing agents and peers.<\/p>\n<p>Or consider <a href=\"https:\/\/www.score.org\/find-mentor\">free business mentoring<\/a> from a retired executive.

From business and marketing plans to budgets, hiring and all the other details you\u2019re responsible for, learning more about small business success is vital.<\/p>\n<p>There are a variety of ways to get started backfilling this hole in your education. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/sba-learning-platform\">U.S. Small Business Administration<\/a> offers a number of online courses. Here are examples of some of the free, online courses offered:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/learn.sba.gov\/learning-center-plan\/learning-center-how-to-write-a-business-plan#course-content\">How to Write a Business Plan<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/document\/report--customer-service-plan\">Customer Service<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/media\/training\/sba_intro_to_acct_09012016\/index.html\">Introduction to Accounting<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Or, check out the free online courses at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kutztown.edu\/about-ku\/administrative-offices\/small-business-development-center\/resources\/free-online-learning-programs.html\">Kutztown University<\/a>.

You\u2019ll find a list of online courses that will help you become a better negotiator and communicator (some provide certificates upon completion) from education giants such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/negotiation\">Yale<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/influencing-people\">University of Michigan<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/understanding-arguments\">Duke University<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Sure, riparian rights and the different ways of holding title are important things to know for real estate agents and real estate school provides that knowledge.<\/p>\n<p>But when it comes to running a small business, marketing your services and your clients\u2019 listings, and negotiating on their behalf for the best deal, you\u2019ll need to look elsewhere for knowledge.<\/p>\n<p>Thankfully, you can find it online, in books, podcasts and videos.
