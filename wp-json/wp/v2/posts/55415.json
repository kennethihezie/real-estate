Lead generation is about feeding the beast \u2013 and the beast is your pipeline. <a href=\"\/blog\/the-5-principles-of-sales-pipeline-management\/\">Pipeline management<\/a> is about putting a long-term strategy in place to work leads through their journey <em>and <\/em>your pipeline.<\/p>\n<p>Six, 12, 18 months down the road you\u2019ll be closing transactions consistently and with far less effort than the agent who dismisses leads in the early stages of their journey.<\/p>\n<p>Everyone you know should fall into one of four stages of the real estate sales pipeline, as mapped out below. There\u2019s no such thing as a cold lead, only someone who isn&#8217;t ready to transact.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Mapping the Real Estate Pipeline &amp; Stages<\/strong><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_55461\" style=\"width: 1210px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/funnel1200.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-55461\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-55461\" src=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/funnel1200.jpg\" alt=\"real estate pipeline infographic\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-55461\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Click to enlarge.<\/p><\/div>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3><strong>1. Leads<\/strong><\/h3>\n<h4>Stage: Top of Funnel \u2013 Awareness<\/h4>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-55463 alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Matt-Heinz.png\" alt=\"quote from Matt Heinz about respecting your customers\" width=\"302\" height=\"222\" \/>Perhaps the most undervalued stage of the real estate pipeline, the awareness stage is where 75 percent of leads are captured, requires the least amount of investment, and offers the most potential for reward &#8211; if you&#8217;re patient and persistent. This sits at the top of the funnel and most people in this stage of their real estate journey are only starting to think about moving or purchasing a home.<\/p>\n<p>Those in the awareness stage of the real estate sales cycle are seeking information and typically prefer to remain anonymous. This doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t contact them, but the way you contact them and your expectations need to be in line with where they\u2019re at in their real estate <a href=\"\/journey\">journey<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Most marketing dollars are spent in this stage, attracting people to your brand, expertise, and services. When you run a Facebook ad offering a free home valuation, you\u2019re attracting people who are seeking information into your funnel so you can help inform their decision-making process.<\/p>\n<p>They\u2019re starting to think about selling and aren\u2019t working with any other agents \u2013 not because they haven\u2019t found one \u2013 but because they\u2019re not ready to work with an agent yet. This is critical to understand.<\/p>\n<p>Advertising brings the lead in, marketing is how you nurture them. This stage of the sales cycle is not about converting leads or closing; it\u2019s your opportunity to offer value, educate, and guide them deeper into their real estate journey so when they are ready to take the next step, it\u2019s with you.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Bottom line: Be known, but let them browse.<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3><strong>2. Prospects<\/strong><\/h3>\n<h4>Stage: Middle of Funnel \u2013 Consideration<\/h4>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright wp-image-55475\" src=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Trust.png\" alt=\"quote about trust and successful business\" width=\"275\" height=\"209\" \/>A lead becomes a prospect when they\u2019ve expressed interest or intent, and are now showing interest in your expertise and services. This is the time to show them what it would be like to work with you and all you have to offer.<\/p>\n<p>A prospect is exploring their options; they\u2019re considering who they\u2019d like to work with and may or may not be ready to choose an agent, but they\u2019re still interested in your expertise. This is your chance to earn the trust of your leads.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Bottom line: <\/strong>\u00a0<strong>Engage them and aid them in their quest for information. <\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3><strong>3. Clients<\/strong><\/h3>\n<h4>Stage: Bottom of Funnel \u2013 Decision<\/h4>\n<p>You\u2019ve gotten the prospect to sign an agreement and you\u2019re actively working with a them to buy or sell a home through this stage.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019re meeting in person, offering recommendations based on their preferences and needs, and providing support with contracts and negotiations. In this stage, you further demonstrate your expertise, while offering support and guidance through the transaction process.<\/p>\n<p>When a prospect becomes a client, it\u2019s important that you do all you can to affirm they\u2019ve made the right decision to have chosen you as their agent.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Bottom line: Give clients a reason to work with you again. <\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3><strong>4. Post-sale<\/strong><\/h3>\n<h4>Stage: Through Funnel \u2013 Source of referrals and repeat business<\/h4>\n<p>You may have closed the transaction, but it\u2019s necessary to stay top-of-mind as past clients are your best source of referrals and repeat business<\/p>\n<p>According to\u00a0the National Association of REALTORS, 64 percent of real estate business is generated from referrals and past buyer clients, and 69 percent from past seller clients. To maximize this huge opportunity that already exists within your network, it\u2019s important to put effort into maintaining relationships post-sale.<\/p>\n<p>Stay top-of-mind with these marketing ideas for\u00a0<a href=\"\/blog\/real-estate-marketing-ideas-for-referrals-repeat-business\/\">referrals and repeat business<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Putting forth the effort to show your clients you care after the transaction has closed will work wonders for your pipeline. Real estate is a long-term game that requires some long-term strategy.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Bottom line: Do not lose contact.<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Remember \u2013 your pipeline is fluid; people will move in, out, and through each stage and your top priority should be to impact and guide their journey any way you can.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4>Looking for more?
