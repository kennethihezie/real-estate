International, Johnny Loewy\u2019s life has been one great big listing presentation.<\/p>\n<p>A Long Island native, Loewy did what many New Yorkers do: \u201cWe grow up in New York and we immigrate to Florida \u2013 there\u2019s a memo about it somewhere,\u201d he said, laughing.<\/p>\n<h2>Selling to Long Islanders<\/h2>\n<p>But it\u2019s in Long Island where Loewy\u2019s tale begins.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI can actually tell you that I created the pet rock before the Pet Rock went national,\u201d he claimed. \u201cAt age four I started to take rocks and paint them and glue eyeballs on them and little pieces of yarn, and I would sell them door to door as paperweights,\u201d Loewy said. Depending on size, the young Loewy made 50 cents to $1 on his inventions.<\/p>\n<p>In the first grade, he decided to open a farm stand. After all, the local commercial farm stand did great business and Loewy\u2019s dad had a vegetable garden.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSo, I started to pick all his vegetables and I set up a little stand on the corner and was selling them,\u201d he recalled. \u201cSales were going great, too, until my dad pulled up and said, \u2018Hey kid what are you doing?\u2019 and I had to report that I was hijacking his vegetables from his garden to sell on the corner for a profit.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>From elementary through high school, Loewy plied his trade, selling candy to fellow students. \u201cI would carry a duffel bag and I would sell anything from Blow Pops to Jolly Rancher sticks, the Astro Pops, Snickers bars \u2013 anything between a quarter and 50 cents was my cup of tea,\u201d he explained.<\/p>\n<p>Since his school had an on-campus store, and it also sold candy, invariably Loewy was asked to close up his candy business and work in the school store instead.<\/p>\n<h2>All it Takes is a Pair of Glasses<\/h2>\n<p>While still in high school, Loewy took a job with a chimney cleaning service. \u201cI\u2019m a little guy and I could fit in the fire boxes and the fireplace and crawl around,\u201d he explained. One day he did some work for a gentleman who just happened to be a real estate agent. He remarked on Loewy\u2019s amazing ability to upsell his company\u2019s products and suggested that Loewy might want to look into a career in real estate.<\/p>\n<p>Loewy felt that, at 18 years of age, he wasn\u2019t ready for the big leagues, so he decided to open his own chimney cleaning business instead. \u201cAfter owning it for a while I realized I didn\u2019t make my money cleaning the chimneys; I made my money getting the business. Cleaning the chimneys was the reward; the work was finding the chimney to clean,\u201d he said. This led him to consider what else he might be able to sell that would bring him more money. Eventually, he sold the chimney cleaning business and got into real estate.<\/p>\n<h2>20 Years Later<\/h2>\n<p>Loewy celebrates 20 years in the industry this year, so we asked him what kind of challenges he faces at this point in his career.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe toughest thing for me as a coach is that I have to face the fact that sometimes I want it more for the student than the student wants it for himself,\u201d he explained. \u201cI can show these guys how they can be great, but at the end of the day, if they don\u2019t want it and they don\u2019t want it bad enough, there ain\u2019t nothing I\u2019m going to be able to show them to get them to make the jump and want to work,\u201d Loewy concluded.<\/p>\n<p>Right now, he runs a real estate team, trains, coaches and recruits. \u201cExit is a company that rewards each agent that finds other great agents who will complement our company,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe introduce them to our firm, and we become almost like a partner in our organization. So, I\u2019m kind of like a talent scout. I find members who I think may be a good fit for Exit and a good fit for me.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Loewy the Headhunter<\/h2>\n<p>Once onboard, Loewy creates a Market Leader website for each of them, throws them some leads, and teaches how to convert them.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI know the importance of lead generation and the importance of Internet leads,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s something that gets an agent up and running quickly and puts a deal in their pockets in days rather than months.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Although he doesn\u2019t actively list and sell real estate any longer, Loewy maintains his license. His real love, though, is headhunting.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cRecruiting is one of my favorite things to do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about hunting. As an agent, you\u2019re hunting for business. As a broker-manager, you\u2019re hunting for agents,\u201d he continued. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you could put me in any one box, but I would say that I definitely like the thrill of the hunt, whether it\u2019s hunting for business, or hunting for prospects, or hunting for that next recruit to put into my brokerage to turn into the next superstar,\u201d he concluded.<\/p>\n<h2>Finding the Right Tools<\/h2>\n<p>\u201cI actually fought Market Leader,\u201d Loewy said when we asked how he was introduced to Market Leader products. \u201cI was probably their toughest sale. I gave those guys such a hard time in the beginning. I told them, \u2018If you get me to sign up with you, you\u2019ve earned this sale.\u2019 And boy did they ever! But you know what? The truth be told, I should\u2019ve done it a year sooner,\u201d he said, laughing.<\/p>\n<p>Loewy explained that he bounced around from company to company until he found the ideal fit with Market Leader\u2019s products. \u201cIt took me awhile,\u201d he began. \u201cIn fact, I tried a lot of companies before I actually went to Market Leader, and when I got with them I still drove them crazy. But man, they are first-class all the way,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey handled me with kid gloves, they took me through the entire process, and they made me feel like I was their only client. They\u2019ve just been great to me; I can\u2019t say enough nice things about the folks at Market Leader.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Loewy swears by the leads he gets from Market Leader, as well. \u201cThey created more lead traffic for me than any other lead source,\u201d he explained. \u201cI\u2019ve heard people say, \u2018Well, you may get a lot of leads, but are they good leads?\u2019 Listen, if you\u2019re a good Realtor\u00ae, they\u2019re good leads. If you can\u2019t convert, you need to be trained on how to convert. But if you\u2019ve got someone that says, \u2018Here\u2019s my email address and I\u2019m looking at this,\u2019 that\u2019s all I need, baby. It\u2019s hunting season,\u201d he said, laughing.<\/p>\n<p>We asked Loewy how he would recommend Market Leader to other real estate agents and brokers. \u201cTake it now or take it later, but eventually you\u2019re going to want them because nobody else compares,\u201d he answered.<\/p>\n<h2>The Best Part of His Job<\/h2>\n<p>Loewy most enjoys helping agents move their careers down a more productive path. \u201cThere\u2019s just nothing like it. It\u2019s a feeling I can\u2019t even describe,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy favorite thing is to see them on that stage at our convention, and they\u2019re holding up an award in their hands,\u201d he said, quietly.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re fighting not to cry on that stage and man, I have to tell you, I fight not to cry sitting in that front row. It\u2019s pretty intense \u2026 you might think I\u2019m a sap, but that stuff makes me cry.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Life Beyond Real Estate<\/h2>\n<p>At this point in his career, the man once listed as one of the Top 50 Realtors\u00ae in the country by the Wall Street Journal ensures he makes time for his life outside of real estate. He and his wife enjoy ballroom dancing twice a week and Loewy does martial arts. They\u2019re also planning an off-the-grid camping trip in the near future.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>From child sales prodigy to one of five national trainers for Exit Realty Corp.
