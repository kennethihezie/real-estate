The discipline that the military parent learns is passed on to his or her offspring, which has served <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/reneehelten\/\">Renee Helten<\/a> of Keller Williams in Englewood, Colo. well.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI grew up all throughout the United States,\u201d she said. \u201cWe made a circle, starting at Nebraska to Virginia near the Washington, D.C. area to Montgomery, Ala. \u2013 culture shock \u2013 to Colorado Springs, and then I became what we call a front-range girl.\u201d The family landed in Denver, where Helten remained for 23 years.<\/p>\n<p>Helton loved living in different parts of the country and being able to meet a diverse array of people. From that, she claims, she gained \u201cthe knowledge, very, very young, that people are people no matter where you are. We\u2019re all very much the same,\u201d she explained. \u201cMaybe different dialects or we sound a little bit different. But all in all, when you\u2019re a 13- or 14-year-old girl, it doesn\u2019t matter if you live in Alabama or Israel &#8211; you still like lip gloss and boys.<\/p>\n<p>Helton\u2019s father, a colonel in the Air Force, taught her organizational skills and, as she explained, \u201ca deep discipline and self-motivation to put 100 percent into everything that I do.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>The Best Laid Plans<\/h2>\n<p>Helten dreamed of becoming a doctor. She obtained a degree in journalism as she worked her way toward that dream but, science tripped her up.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAfter the second year of biology and chemistry classes and not doing great at organic chemistry, I decided that I didn\u2019t want to go to school for 13 more years, so I wrote for a medical magazine and newsletters,\u201d she recalled.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThen I went into special events and things like that for about two years. The second floor of the building I worked in had a little sign that said \u2018real estate school upstairs,\u2019\u201d Helten said.<\/p>\n<p>After figuring out that no matter how hard she worked she\u2019d still make the same amount of money, she decided to check out the real estate school.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSo I went upstairs and the person that ran the real estate school &#8211; within 10 minutes of talking to me &#8211; said that she would hire me and train me,\u201d Helten explained. \u201cThat\u2019s what she and her husband did for a year, and I have not looked back. I will start my 18<sup>th<\/sup> year in real estate in November of this year.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Challenges<\/h2>\n<p>I asked Helten what the challenges of a real estate veteran look like. \u201cJuggling different tasks all at the same time &#8211; from technology and time management to anything that deals with people &#8211; and negotiations and contracts and law in between,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>She also faces challenges running the Helten team, with seven members including her.<\/p>\n<h2>Marketing and Referrals<\/h2>\n<p>Helten was introduced to Market Leader products when she joined Keller Williams. I asked her how her business has been impacted since adopting Market Leader products.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt has doubled,\u201d she claimed, \u201cespecially with my Internet lead generation. I buy a certain amount of leads every month so that on a Google search or a Bing or a Yahoo, my search engine optimization for my eEdge website goes up.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>She also mentioned that the team uses Craigslist and House Values. \u201cAll of that combined has made it so that my Internet lead generation has tripled from three years ago,\u201d Helten said. \u201cIt\u2019s just momentum and it\u2019s consistency over time. You cannot expect to change your whole marketing business plan in a 90-day period of time,\u201d she cautioned. \u201cIt\u2019s a six to nine months\u2019 time period. Now I\u2019m almost at three years of working this aspect of lead generation and it\u2019s good &#8211; a good pipeline and a good funnel of leads coming through.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Helten is also adept at cultivating relationships with past clients to keep referrals coming in.<\/p>\n<p>She insists that all Helten team members, including herself, talk to someone in the database three to four times a year. \u201cPreferably, one of those four times includes seeing them in person,\u201d she said, \u201cdoing something that\u2019s as easy as having coffee or inviting them to one of our events.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Helten team events include a \u201cbig Halloween event, and then we do a client appreciation event in the summertime,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to see them once a year, if not twice a year, and really keep up with that database &#8211; making sure they\u2019re not just names on a screen but people that we invest in,\u201d Helten concluded.<\/p>\n<h2>What Sets Agents Apart?<\/h2>\n<p>\u201cThe one thing that I teach, the one thing that I preach about real estate and real estate professionals, is we all have the same 168 hours a week. What makes it so that one person is more successful than somebody else is the way in which they use that finite amount of time,\u201d Helten said. \u201cYou have to really be able to manage your time: to know what to do and how quickly to do it. That\u2019s what technology does for me; it buys me time.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>When She Isn\u2019t Working<\/h2>\n<p>Helten leads a balanced life. \u201cI have two kiddos; I have a 16-year-old boy, and a 14-year-old girl, and the most amazing husband on the planet,\u201d she said. \u201cMy son plays football and my daughter is very involved in youth group and church activities, and I hang out with them and watch football practice and all of that kind of good stuff,\u201d Helten continued. \u201cI work about 55 hours a week and I spend about another 35 to 40 hours a week with them. So, I\u2019m very balanced in what I do.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The family loves to travel and always has a trip planned. \u201cWe go on two or three major family trips every year,\u201d Helten said. Active in her church, the family goes on short-term mission trips. \u201cWe have been to Israel and the Czech Republic. I have it in my blood to travel,\u201d she said, chuckling. \u201cMy family and I have been to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. That\u2019s kind of what I look forward to \u2013 I like to work hard, but I like to play hard.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Growing up, military brats experience a lot more than seeing the world.
