It seems that beads were out and iPads were in! Vendors were giving them away all day long it seemed, and everyone wanted one (we will cover the iPad obsession in a future blog).<\/p>\n<p>The speakers were fantastic from Chris Smith @TechSavvyAgent to Stefan Swanepoel <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/swanepoel\">@Swanepoel <\/a>and all of the others throughout the convention. I stand amazed at the level of presenters\u00a0who participated.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The convention floor was where it was happening this year! There were some great booths but it was easy to get lost in the huge space! Many of the booths were providing great training with theatres built into their space. From Kodak with the latest in cameras, to Realtor.com sharing information, to <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/market_leader\">@Market_Leader <\/a>sharing tips and needed skills for agents. Ben Kinney, the creator of The Internet Marketing Specialist Designation, was often found speaking to crowds at the Market Leader theatre, helping everyone learn how to succeed using the Internet and social media in today&#8217;s world.<\/p>\n<p>There were fewer booths at the event than in the past,\u00a0but\u00a0each one seems to\u00a0get larger at each convention I attend. Swag was down this year (and we all know that us Realtors LOVE free stuff). You could find pens, and stress balls BUT the hot item this year was the geeky t-shirt from the IMSD booth.<\/p>\n<p>The information that the National Association of Realtors brings to it&#8217;s agents is always powerful and this year was no exception. Now we&#8217;ve packed up from The Big Easy and are headed to the Magic Kingdom. I look forward to seeing you all next year and hearing what NAR has to share with us (my question&#8230;is will more people be excited to meet Mickey Mouse than were in line for the Hoff?)<\/p>\n<p>Chad Hyams<br \/>\n<em>Team Leader, Keller Williams Western Realty \u2013 Bellingham WA<\/em><em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As a Realtor of 10 years, this year was my FIRST\u00a0journey to the National Association of Realtors Convention.\u00a0 I found parts of it easy and parts of it&#8230;well&#8230;not so easy&#8230; Getting there was pretty\u00a0simple as the airport wasn&#8217;t too big and a cab was always waiting, BUT&#8230;\u00a0 Are there any cities beyond reach of Louisiana [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":33,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_et_pb_use_builder":"","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":""},"categories":[27],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/649"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/33"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=649"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/649\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=649"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=649"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=649"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
