At some point, the power of language has to take over.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The best real estate listing description examples you can find will all have one thing in common: they\u2019ll all have compelling marketing copy that was crafted to <em>sell<\/em>, not just describe.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve been overlooking the sales power of copy in your listing descriptions, welcome. You\u2019re not the only one. Mediocre (if not flat out poor) descriptions are the norm. And that\u2019s unfortunate. Because listing descriptions are extremely important.<\/p>\n<p>Consumers are now more likely to search online for a home than ever before. According to a recent report from <a href=\"https:\/\/cdn.nar.realtor\/sites\/default\/files\/documents\/2022-home-buyers-and-sellers-generational-trends-03-23-2022.pdf\">NAR<\/a>, \u201cAmong all generations of home buyers, the first step taken in the home search process was to look online for properties.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Half of all buyers they surveyed (51%) said they found the home they purchased online. (Which is almost double the amount of those who said they found their home through their agent, by the way.)<\/p>\n<p><strong>The point is, real estate listing descriptions matter. They may even matter a lot, especially if they\u2019re done well.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>And the best part is, it\u2019s not as if you have to spend a ton of time mastering the art and science of copywriting. All it takes to boost the selling power of your listing descriptions is a bit of know-how and some practice.<\/p>\n<p>This article will walk you through exactly how to write descriptions that sell (and how not to write them). Then we\u2019ll take a look at four real estate listing description examples from top-notch agents so you can see how it\u2019s done.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">How To Write a Real Estate Listing Description<\/h2>\n<p>Here are some best practices to keep in mind as you supercharge your listings with compelling marketing copy.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">Start With the Seller<\/h3>\n<p>As the agent, you can put pieces together and come up with some ideas about what you should highlight in the description. But the seller has a unique perspective on the home, and they know better than you do what it\u2019s like to live there day to day. They\u2019ll almost certainly raise excellent selling points that never would have occurred to you unless you had asked.<\/p>\n<p>Find out what it was that originally caught their attention when they bought. What do they love about it? What will they miss when they sell?<\/p>\n<p>Their favorite things about the home are likely to be the same things that will attract potential buyers. So before you work your marketing magic, get inspiration straight from the sellers themselves.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">Write to Your Audience<\/h3>\n<p>In other words, don\u2019t write listing descriptions that only sound good to you and your client. Let it all revolve around potential buyers (and their agent).<\/p>\n<p>Listing agents are, above all else, marketers. And marketers always determine a target buyer for their products before coming up with a plan.<\/p>\n<p>We don\u2019t see urban streetwear companies appealing to Gen X or Baby Boomers. Millennials aren\u2019t likely to get targeted online ads from AARP. Yet the average listing description is a lot like the average real estate agent \u2013 trying to be all things to all people. That has never worked before, and it won\u2019t work for you.<\/p>\n<p>So before you write a word, put yourself in your prospects\u2019 shoes. What will they want to hear? What are the kinds of things they\u2019ll be looking for? Write their dream home into your copy.<\/p>\n<p>What objections or fears might they have? Cut them off at the pass and address concerns head-on. Do they think it\u2019s unaffordable? Talk about how easy financing can be.<\/p>\n<p>Is it a family home with a large backyard and schools nearby? Speak directly to the parents. Is it a swanky uptown condo that looks like a status symbol? Speak to that millionaire entrepreneur looking for a home that doubles as an accessory.<\/p>\n<p>Your listing descriptions need a personal flair that cater to the home buyers you\u2019re trying to reach. Play into their vision, and make it clear that your listing is exactly what they\u2019re looking for.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">Craft a Killer Headline<\/h3>\n<p>The amazing listing description you labored to create is worthless if no one reads it. And the best way to get potential buyers to read your description is to write a headline they can\u2019t ignore, a headline that captures their attention and sets the tone for the entire listing.<\/p>\n<p>The main purpose of the headline is to get them to read the first line of your description. And the main purpose of that first line is to get them to read your second line, and on and on it goes.<\/p>\n<p>If you spent as much time crafting the headline as you did writing the description, it would be time well spent.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">Think Like a Copywriter<\/h3>\n<p>When you\u2019re writing real estate listing descriptions, you\u2019re writing to sell. At its core, what you\u2019re doing here is no different than what legendary advertising experts like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.oneclub.org\/hall-of-fame\/-bio\/david-ogilvy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">David Ogilvy<\/a> did for decades.<\/p>\n<p>So don\u2019t approach this task as a real estate agent filling in the blank on a form that says \u201cDescription\u201d. Approach it as if you were Mad Men\u2019s Don Draper penning irresistible marketing copy that turns heads and closes deals.<\/p>\n<p>To make your \u201cadman\u201d impersonation believable, here are some quick-and-dirty tips for writing like a copywriter.<\/p>\n<ul class=\"BlogUL\">\n<li class=\"BlogLI\"><strong>Lead with the benefits.<\/strong> Then move to the features. In other words, talk first about how the home will benefit the buyer, what problems it may solve for them, and why all of that matters. Then get into the specs and nitty-gritty details.<\/li>\n<li class=\"BlogLI\"><strong>Write like a human.<\/strong> Studies have proven over and over that simple, person-to-person writing is most effective. So say what you mean and keep it conversational. Read it out loud to test yourself \u2013 if it sounds like normal human speech, you\u2019re on the right track!<\/li>\n<li class=\"BlogLI\"><strong>Be concise.<\/strong> Less is (often) more when it comes to writing marketing copy. Use powerful words that pack a punch instead of frivolous adverbs.<\/li>\n<li class=\"BlogLI\"><strong>Create a sense of urgency.<\/strong> Buyers know homes don\u2019t stay on the market for long. Give them that extra nudge they need to take action now by <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/sales\/create-sense-of-urgency-in-prospect-roleplay\">creating a sense of urgency<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li class=\"BlogLI\"><strong>\u201cShow, don\u2019t tell.\u201d<\/strong> Guide their daydreaming and create mental images. Why list the dimensions of the kitchen when you could say, \u201cYou can cook for 2 or 20 in this spacious, guest-friendly kitchen.\u201d Instead of stating flatly that the ceilings are made of plaster, mention that they could \u201centertain beneath soaring Venetian plaster ceilings.\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">Don\u2019t Do This When You Write Listing Descriptions<\/h2>\n<p>Now you know how to write real estate listing descriptions. But here\u2019s what not to do.<\/p>\n<ul class=\"BlogUL\">\n<li class=\"BlogLI\"><strong>Don\u2019t overthink it.<\/strong> Yes, your listing descriptions are important. But the stakes aren\u2019t so high that you need to spend hours and hours crafting a perfect piece. Why? First, because it\u2019ll take you way too long to write. And also because your writing will show that you overthought it, which will make it less effective.<\/li>\n<li class=\"BlogLI\"><strong>Don\u2019t use clever or flowery language.<\/strong> Write plainly. This isn\u2019t a novel. The words themselves shouldn\u2019t steal the spotlight. Yes, think creatively, but don\u2019t distract the prospect with pretty prose. It\u2019s counterproductive and misses the point completely.<\/li>\n<li class=\"BlogLI\"><strong>Don\u2019t repeat information.<\/strong> Space is valuable. Don\u2019t waste it by repeating all of the details that show up in the listing details. Describe the property in a way that doesn\u2019t tell them what they already know (e.g., lot size, year built, etc.).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There are more blunders to avoid. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/blog\/5-cringe-worthy-mistakes-experienced-agents-make-on-their-listings\/\">Learn about the five cringe-worthy mistakes experienced agents make on their listings.<\/a><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">4 Creative Real Estate Listing Description Examples<\/h2>\n<p>Glean wisdom from these four noteworthy listing description examples from expert real estate agents and let the inspiration begin.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">1. Evoke Settings &amp; Scenes<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-61763 \" src=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Cathedral.png\" alt=\"Real estate listing description example #1\" width=\"443\" height=\"760\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This first listing description example does a great job of using language to create mental images. For example, we imagine waking up in the loft suite, hosting a big party out on the deck, and huddling around the fire pit. Framing your listing descriptions in this way gets your prospects to \u201cread between the lines\u201d and see in their mind\u2019s eye more than what appears in the copy. (Plus, this listing gets extra credit for ending with that perfect call to action!)<\/p>\n<p>Well done, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eastsidepropertysearch.com\/listing\/mlsid\/185\/propertyid\/1997697\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Aubie Pouncey<\/a>!<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">2. Pile Up All the Perks<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-61764\" src=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Lynnwood.png\" alt=\"Real estate listing description example #2\" width=\"443\" height=\"763\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Notice how this listing description example heaps on the goodness. Just when you think it couldn\u2019t get any better, it does. We learn immediately that it\u2019s \u201cbetter than new\u201d in that fantastic opening line. As we read on, we hear about upgrade after upgrade, with the excitement-building repetition of the word \u201cnew\u201d. By the end, it sets the prospect up to feel like the decision to make a move on this house is a no-brainer. Numerous renovations, great floor plan, \u201cdramatic two story entry,\u201d private yard, fantastic location\u2026 What more could you want!?<\/p>\n<p>Thanks for showing us how it\u2019s done, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.elizabethavery.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Elizabeth Avery<\/a>!<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">3. Show Authentic Enthusiasm<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-61765\" src=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Bramble.png\" alt=\"Real estate listing description example #3\" width=\"443\" height=\"761\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The excitement is palpable. And yet, it doesn\u2019t come across as contrived or cheesy. This home\u2019s apparent uniqueness speaks for itself, and the copy in this third listing description example does a great job of emphasizing that fact. It leaves the reader feeling as if they just have to see it to believe it. It\u2019s hard not to feel joyful when you read things like, \u201cthis home is nothing short of AMAZING,\u201d and, \u201cThis location is one you just can\u2019t recreate!\u201d And as a side note, who doesn\u2019t want to work with an agent with that kind of contagious energy!?<\/p>\n<p>We can feel your beachside happiness all the way from here, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.peggyrowerealty.com\/listing\/mlsid\/297\/propertyid\/900674\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Peggy Rowe<\/a>!<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">4. Speak to the Heart of Your Audience With Laser-like Focus<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-61766 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Scottsdale.png\" alt=\"Real estate listing descriptions example #4\" width=\"443\" height=\"735\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This final home listing description example demonstrates why it\u2019s so important to understand your audience. If you have a thorough understanding of who your potential buyers are, what they care about, and what their pain points are, you\u2019ll know exactly how to capture their hearts with your listing description. This example has a very clear target (buyers interested in downsizing; buyers who have prioritized convenience and simplicity; buyers looking for a vacation home, seasonal home, or a home they can feel comfortable leaving behind when they travel). And the entire listing description is centered on meeting their needs and addressing their concerns.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pollyblackwell.com\/listing\/mlsid\/8\/propertyid\/6477055\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Polly Blackwell<\/a>!
