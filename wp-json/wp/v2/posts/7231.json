Your friends at Market Leader are among the 400 industry vendors at the Orange County Convention Center in Orlando, Fla. The energy in this place is amazing!<\/p>\n<p>Friday was Realtor\u00ae Spirit Day in case you were wondering why everyone was decked out in their company t-shirts. There was also a full slate of workshops \u2013 everything from Top Tools for Global Professionals to a property management forum and a workshop on selling luxury properties. There were definitely lots of good educational opportunities for agents.<\/p>\n<p>So, yes, the conference offers you a chance to catch up with issues that affect your business, and you can tell your broker you\u2019re here to continue your \u201cprofessional development,\u201d but we know most of us come here for the swag, and there\u2019s a ton of it.<\/p>\n<p>Realtors\u00ae from all over the world are stopping by the Market Leader booth (number 2181, toward the northeast part of the convention center) to test their luck at our \u201cUnlock an iPad\u201d contest. Yup, we\u2019re giving away iPads. You can check one out in the glass jeweler\u2019s case at our booth. Stick your hand into the fishbowl full of keys, pull one out, and if it unlocks the case, you walk with a brand new iPad!<\/p>\n<p>Wells Fargo has a fabulous booth with phenomenal attendance. It could be that there\u2019s horse racing there. I kind of have a feeling, though, that the fact that they\u2019re giving away a Chrysler 300C has a lot to do with all the Realtors\u00ae\u00a0hanging around Booth 1151. Good luck to all who enter!<\/p>\n<h2>Vanessa\u2019s Fave-Booth-of-the-Day<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-7291\" style=\"margin: 5px 10px\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/11\/NAR-2012-booth-car-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"NAR 2012 booth car\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" \/>DotLoop (booth 2065), with its \u201cBack to the Future\u201d theme, including the flux capacitored, stress-ball-filled DeLorean is my pick for Booth-of-the-Day. Be sure and stop by &#8211; they\u2019re giving away t-shirts and other fun stuff.<\/p>\n<p>Last night we headed out for Realtor\u00ae\u2019s Night Out at Universal\u2019s Islands of Adventure. The park was closed to all but Realtors\u00ae and their families &#8211; what a great treat. The perks that come with this great educational conference are amazing.<\/p>\n<p>Today we open the Market Leader booth at 9 a.m. and the first 25 people who mention they read this blog post will win a $5 Starbucks gift certificate, so come on by!<\/p>\n<h2>Vanessa\u2019s NAR Conference and Expo Tip of the Day:<\/h2>\n<p>Exit Realty (booth 703, in the southwest corner of the convention center) is giving away huge carry bags.
