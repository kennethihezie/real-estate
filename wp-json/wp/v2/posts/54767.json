Read their digital body language.<\/p>\n<p>While networking and <a href=\"\/blog\/dont-knock-it-till-you-try-it-door-knocking-tips-for-agents\/\">door knocking<\/a> are great for getting in front of new people, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nar.realtor\/research-and-statistics\/research-reports\/home-buyer-and-seller-generational-trends\">88 percent<\/a> of real estate buyers and sellers have taken their search for information online and 88 percent of consumers across industries avoid face-to-face meetings whenever possible.<\/p>\n<p>Digital body language is the aggregate of someone\u2019s online behavior. This can include visits to your website, likes on social media, even unsubscribing from an email campaign.<\/p>\n<h3>Understanding Digital Body Language<\/h3>\n<p>Every digital interaction a person has with your business will\u00a0tell you something about who they are, what they\u2019re looking for, where they&#8217;re at in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/journey\/\">buyer\u2019s journey<\/a>, and illustrate their intent. The more interactions a person has with you online, the better you\u2019ll understand them \u2013 which will help you anticipate their needs, send personalized messages, and targeted content based on what they&#8217;ve communicated with you.<\/p>\n<p>If read properly, digital body language should help you turn visitors into leads and leads into clients.<\/p>\n<p>Behavior triggers are your window of opportunity. Certain behaviors communicate interests and intent and should prompt you to act quickly based on the information you acquire through digital cues.<\/p>\n<h4>1. Viewed Homes<\/h4>\n<p>The homes consumers view says a lot about the type of home they are interested in, or what type of home they\u2019re looking to sell. Identify trends and patterns like the ones below:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Type of home (condo, townhouse, single family home)<br \/>\n\u2022 Neighborhoods<br \/>\n\u2022 Price range<br \/>\n\u2022 Features (view, vaulted ceilings, pool)<br \/>\n\u2022 Number of bedrooms and bathrooms<\/p>\n<p>Does anything stand out about the homes that were viewed? For example, a visitor has viewed multiple homes in a family-friendly neighborhood with 3-4 bedrooms within a certain price range.<\/p>\n<p>You can assume they\u2019re looking to buy or sell something similar. Look them up on social media and see if they\u2019re growing their family and looking to size-up, or maybe you see they\u2019re a more mature client who\u2019s likely looking to downsize.<\/p>\n<p>Identifying patterns allows you do dig deeper into their journey and provide relevant content and communications to begin the nurturing process.<\/p>\n<h4>2. Saved Homes<\/h4>\n<p>Saved homes communicate similar cues as viewed homes, but suggest that the consumer is further along in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/journey\/\">customer journey<\/a>. With this knowledge, you\u2019re equipped to fully engage with them. If someone is actively saving listings, they\u2019re likely moving beyond the research stage of their customer journey to consideration: saving, reviewing, comparing listings against each other or possibly their current home.<\/p>\n<p>If a visitor is saving information on your website, they\u2019re serious about the information they\u2019ve sought out and would likely appreciate any additional information you provide them.<\/p>\n<h6>TIP: Go above and beyond by pulling up all a prospect\u2019s saved homes in the MLS and collect as much information on them as you can. Try and find information that isn\u2019t available to consumers so you have unique value to bring to the table when you contact the lead.<\/h6>\n<h4>3. Unsubscribes<\/h4>\n<p>Don\u2019t panic, and don\u2019t take it personal. This could signal they\u2019re not quite ready for ongoing communications. They might have been conducting initial research and subscribed to get more information, but simply prefer not to be contacted yet.<\/p>\n<p>Their customer journey might still be in infancy or\u00a0 perhaps they&#8217;re not interested in a particular type of messaging. Be on the lookout for online activity and always circle back to check in. Unsubscribing or opting out of a marketing campaign doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they\u2019re not interested. Set reminders to look at their behavior in 60-90 days to see when they were last active, what they were looking at, and find a way to offer them value.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve said it before and we&#8217;ll say it again: the real estate sales cycle can take years. Understanding that some leads won&#8217;t be ready to transact for months, even years, can be used to your advantage. Imagine all the opportunities missed by agents who fail to respect the sales cycle and customer journey, and dismiss leads after an unsubscribe.<\/p>\n<p>Demonstrating expertise and proving that you\u2019re a valuable resource at every stage of their journey is what wins business.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4>Looking for more?
