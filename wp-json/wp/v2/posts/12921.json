Here\u2019s how.\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" \/>When you list, you last, or so the old saying goes. How, then is an agent expected to last when finding a homeowner who wants to list is like trying to find Waldo?<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s the question on the top of agents\u2019 minds nationwide. Forbes real estate writer Morgan Brennan tells us that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/morganbrennan\/2013\/02\/21\/sellers-market-developing-as-housing-inventory-hits-a-13-year-low\/\">buyer interest is high<\/a> \u2013 40 percent above what it was last year. Inventory, on the other hand, has dropped over 25 percent from where it was last year. Some markets are worse than others \u2013 Seattle, for instance, had one month of inventory in March and April, according to Sam DeBord with Coldwell Banker Danforth.<\/p>\n<p>Ok, so in much of the country it\u2019s a seller\u2019s market. It seems, however, that someone forgot to mention that to homeowners.<\/p>\n<p>A lot of the experts recommend a return to the basics in this changing market if you hope to attract homeowners who want to sell. Others say that may be a waste of time. Let\u2019s take a look at some cost-effective ways to market to sellers.<\/p>\n<p>Tip: If you don\u2019t have a database so you can use contact management software, take the time to build one. The software is the tool you\u2019ll use the most in your efforts to attract listing clients.<\/p>\n<h2>You\u2019re Getting Warmer<\/h2>\n<p>Start with the warmest contacts in your database and work your way to the cold prospects. This means starting with your sphere of influence \u2013 reaching out to family, friends and past clients with the age-old question: \u201cDo you know anyone who is planning on selling their house?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Even if the answer is no right now, the story may be completely different next week, and you\u2019ll be top-of-mind after reaching out.<\/p>\n<p>In her efforts to find homes for her buyers, St. Paul agent\/broker <a href=\"https:\/\/www.stpaulrealestateblog.com\/\">Teresa Boardman<\/a> struck on an interesting idea. She went through her database and pulled out the names of homeowners to whom she gave a listing presentation sometime in the last three years. After checking to ensure they hadn\u2019t sold with someone else, and crunching some numbers to determine if they were underwater, she started contacting them.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSome of them were unrealistic,\u201d she explains, \u201cwanting $275,000 for a house that\u2019s worth $200,000.\u201d Out of the few calls she\u2019s made so far, however, the plan seems to be working. \u201cOne I\u2019m going to list for sure, and another one looks like a real strong possibility, and another is trying to decide if he should rent out the house or sell it,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<h2>A Little Colder<\/h2>\n<p>Another technique that typically works during low inventory periods is to go after expired, cancelled and withdrawn listings. Real estate trainer Tom Ferry suggests choosing the worst year to be on the market out of the past three years and aggressively marketing to those homeowners. Even if they don\u2019t want to list right now, put them on a drip campaign; chances are good that they will sell their homes in the future. Sure, it\u2019s old-school, but it works, and most significantly, it\u2019s cost-effective.<\/p>\n<p>If you live in a market like Seattle, however, this method may not work. \u201cThe difficulty is that there aren\u2019t many expired listings right now. We have maybe 20 expired listings a week, and that\u2019s not enough for even one office to pursue,\u201d Seattle\u2019s DeBord says.<\/p>\n<h2>Cast a Wider Net<\/h2>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to connect with people through social media and through blogging,\u201d explains DeBord. \u201cWe\u2019re getting the word out that it\u2019s not just that the market has gotten better, it\u2019s that there\u2019s no competition for sellers right now.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And it\u2019s working, for both he and Boardman. \u201cI wrote a blog post and shared it in a couple of places,\u201d DeBord explains. \u201cI got a call from an old acquaintance that read the post on LinkedIn and was surprised that the market had changed so much.\u201d Yes, he got the listing. Boardman picked up two this week that she can directly trace back to her blog.<\/p>\n<p>Bellingham, Wash. real estate ace Ben Kinney suggests that since buyers and sellers want completely different information, creating a dedicated seller\u2019s website is important. Then, target your marketing to drive all potential home sellers in the area to that site. If the site is integrated with your contact management system, you can track the leads in real time and respond quickly.<\/p>\n<p>Jun Choo, general manager of advertising for Market Leader, cautions that this strategy is only viable for agents who generate hundreds of leads a month and work large areas. \u201cIt is very difficult to drive targeted PPC traffic for seller leads,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>One option is to buy seller leads. If you work them right, Internet listing leads can be a cost-effective marketing tool. Make sure that you buy from a company that ensures exclusivity in your market or zip code and promises a set number of leads per month. Market Leader offers a seller lead product called <a href=\"\/products\/real-estate-leads\/\">HouseValues<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Sure, inventory is low right now, and sellers are reluctant to jump into the market. But adapting to a changing market by combining technology with some of the prospecting tools you learned as a rookie provides you the ability to list \u2013 and last.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When you list, you last, or so the old saying goes.
