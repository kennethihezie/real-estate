You offer stellar customer service. You\u2019ve developed a killer website. Even your branding is cool.<\/p>\n<p>Guess what? It\u2019s not enough.<\/p>\n<p>Not in 2018.<\/p>\n<p>Like this year\u2019s, next year\u2019s clients want proof before they agree to work with you. And, they want proof from people who have actually used your real estate services.<\/p>\n<p>Make 2018 the year you focus on gathering the social proof you need to help potential clients judge your credibility as a real estate authority, get to know you, and build trust.<\/p>\n<h3>What is social proof?<\/h3>\n<p>A herd of sheep will instinctually stick together, for protection. Where one goes, the others follow \u2013 whether it\u2019s back to the farm for supper or to the slaughterhouse, the instinct rules.<\/p>\n<p>We humans have similar inclinations. A famous 1969 study (Milgram et al.) on \u201cthe drawing power of crowds of different sizes\u201d found that 4 percent of folks passing by would stop to join one person looking up at a skyscraper.<\/p>\n<p>When there were 15 people looking skyward, the number of passersby who stopped to join them increased to 40 percent. Additionally, 86 percent of passersby, even if they didn\u2019t stop, would look up to see what everyone was looking at.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe often imitate others\u2019 actions when making choices with limited information about what\u2019s best,\u201d claims David Stipp at <a href=\"https:\/\/archive.fortune.com\/magazines\/fortune\/fortune_archive\/1996\/10\/14\/217822\/index.htm\">Fortune.com<\/a>. \u201cIt\u2019s almost a law of nature,\u201d he concludes.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s herd behavior and, although it can have negative consequences, it can also be a boon to your marketing efforts.<\/p>\n<h3>Why does it matter?<\/h3>\n<p>A majority of the 2,000 Americans surveyed by Mintel, a market analysis agency, say that online reviews dictate which products they buy and services they use.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s only natural, right? We all want to ensure that we\u2019re purchasing the \u201cbest\u201d product or hiring the \u201cbest\u201d hair stylist.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn a never-ending quest to buy the \u2018best,\u2019 consumers are looking to others\u2019 opinions and experiences via online review sites to validate their choices \u2013 and to avoid feeling buyers\u2019 remorse,\u201d Mintel\u2019s Fiona O\u2019Donnell claims in their American Lifestyles 2015 study.<\/p>\n<p>Although consumers of all ages perform this gut check, it is far more common in millennials than in older and younger generations. And, since that particular demographic represents the real estate consumers of tomorrow, social proof becomes even more important.<\/p>\n<h3>How is your online reputation?<\/h3>\n<p>The first thing to consider when starting a social proof campaign is to determine where you stand right now. Will you be starting with a blank slate or multitudes of reviews scattered across the internet?<\/p>\n<p>How many negative reviews will you need to combat? Cleaning up your online reputation takes time and effort unless you have the big bucks required to hire a company to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/susanadams\/2013\/03\/14\/6-steps-to-managing-your-online-reputation\/?sh=5a12293b7767\">manage your online reputation.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>And, lest you think image polishing isn\u2019t important, consider this: 75 percent of HR professionals and recruiters say that they have \u201cpersonnel to research applicants online,\u201d according to a Cross-Tab <a href=\"https:\/\/www.job-hunt.org\/guides\/DPD_Online-Reputation-Research_overview.pdf\">study<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Even more frightening (at least for job hunters) is that 70 percent of these hiring pros claim that they have rejected candidates based on what they found out about them online.<\/p>\n<p>Sure, you\u2019re not hoping to be recruited, but if HR professionals seek out social proof for job applicants, it\u2019s a safe bet that real estate consumers do the same when researching real estate agents.<\/p>\n<h3>Types of social proof to consider for your real estate business:<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Review sites<\/strong> &#8212; It\u2019s not enough to have online reviews and testimonials on one site. Gut checkers view two to three different review sites before they make a decision, according to BrightLocal\u2019s Consumer Review Survey 2016.<\/p>\n<p>When researching real estate agents, these review sites typically include Yelp, Zillow and Google. Since Google search results for \u201creal estate agents in\u201d typically come with Google reviews, it\u2019s a good idea to concentrate on the search giant first. Setting up a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/business\/?gmbsrc=us-en-ha-se-z-gmb-s-z-h~bk&amp;ppsrc=GMBS0&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI8v7G8IWF1wIVCmh-Ch2LrQtWEAAYASAAEgIDkvD_BwE&amp;dclid=CImD6PeFhdcCFRB2Ygodb-APEA\">Google Business Page<\/a> is a great place to start.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Testimonials<\/strong> \u2013 BrightLocal\u2019s survey found that the \u201cauthenticity of reviews is the most important factor for consumers to trust the reviews they read.\u201d They want to know that these testimonials are coming from actual people \u2013 clients who have used you to represent them when buying or selling a home.<\/p>\n<p>Bring your testimonials to life by including a photo of your clients (with their permission, of course) <a href=\"\/blog\/2018-real-estate-trends-content-marketing-reigns-king\/\">above<\/a> their glowing recommendation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Case studies<\/strong> \u2013 These are another way to give life to your testimonials. They are basically stories that illustrate a client\u2019s problem and how you, as an agent, solved it. Not only are they effective on websites, but because of they are typically photo-intensive, they work well when included with other marketing materials, such as listing presentations and newsletters.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Take it offline, too.\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Testimonials can be used in all of your marketing materials as long as you don\u2019t overdo it. Choose one or two of your favorites and use them in your newsletters.<\/p>\n<p>Use them in listing presentations, on door hangers, direct mail pieces \u2013 all of your offline marketing materials can and should contain at least one testimonial.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Make 2018 the Year You Leverage Social Proof You have tons of experience.
