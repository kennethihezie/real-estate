With <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nar.realtor\/sites\/default\/files\/documents\/2021-home-buyers-and-sellers-generational-trends-03-16-2021.pdf\">97% of homebuyers searching online<\/a>, your digital presence is not only important, it&#8217;s necessary to provide the real estate experience consumers expect today. As consumer expectations rise and attention spans become shorter, real estate marketing automation guarantees that no lead goes untouched and keeps you top-of-mind throughout the entire home buying and selling journeys.<\/p>\n<p>Marketing automation saves the time and energy it would take to perform marketing tasks manually by automating the creation, scheduling, and sending of marketing campaigns. Real estate marketing automation streamlines lead generation and management, email marketing, the creation of single property websites, listing marketing, and social media marketing, so agents can focus on spending more time in front of their clients.<\/p>\n<p>Having a CRM that supports your business is key. We recommend a platform that tracks lead behavior and automatically updates your contact database with new leads as they come into your funnel \u2013 whether they\u2019re coming from your website, from third party sources like social media, or referrals.<\/p>\n<p>Most CRMs come with the ability to automate repetitive tasks and marketing communications, like sending a follow up email to a new lead with listings they just saved on your website. Automation can do a lot of heavy lifting for you, when done correctly.<\/p>\n<p>Your real estate CRM should track your lead\u2019s activity on your website and help you engage with them accordingly by sending them automated listing alerts from your MLS, letting you know when they are active on your website so you can strike while the iron is hot, and with drip campaigns that provide consistent and relevant information to help them through their real estate journey.<\/p>\n<p>An intuitive CRM that can monitor your lead\u2019s activity is going to put you in the position to speak directly to their interests and activities in a way that\u2019s neither invasive or creepy. In today\u2019s digital world, customers are targeted by technology that tracks their online activity, allowing you to speak to them, wherever they are in their customer journey. Once you know what your leads are searching for and interested in, you can cultivate personalized messaging to engage them, build trust, and earn their business.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe right CRM will have real estate marketing automation and go to work for you, helping you manage and nurture relationships who aren\u2019t quite ready to transact, so you can focus on spending more time in front of clients.
