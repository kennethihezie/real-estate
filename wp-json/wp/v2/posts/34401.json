There, she settled into her life as a stay-at-home mom of three kids.<\/p>\n<p>All was well, until her divorce in 1997. \u201cI had to find a way to make a living at the ripe age of 40-something,\u201d she recalls.<\/p>\n<p>She worked briefly as a legal secretary for a real estate attorney when she came up with a plan to get her real estate license. That was 13 years ago, and though she\u2019s spent time working with several national brokerages, she\u2019s now found that a locally-owned boutique firm\u2014Tierra Antigua\u2014is the best fit for her.<\/p>\n<p>Schlott has built up a large roster of past clients. She figures that those folks and referrals make up about 80 percent of her business. Even with that edge, she says her biggest challenge at the 13-year mark in her career is trying to get friends and acquaintances to remember that she\u2019s a real estate agent.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI had that happen recently,\u201d she explained. \u201cI just found out that an acquaintance got a divorce and he sold his house and bought another one, all within the last nine months.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Because she gets so much business from past clients and referrals, Schlott is at a stage in her business where she doesn\u2019t need to do a lot of marketing for new clients.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI am mostly using Market Leader, social media and occasionally sending out just-listed and just-sold cards. I\u2019m lazy. I don\u2019t do a lot of marketing,\u201d she said, laughing.<\/p>\n<h2>The Market Leader Edge<\/h2>\n<p>Schlott was introduced to Market Leader products during a brief stint with Keller Williams Realty. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you, Market Leader offers one of the best websites out there,\u201d she said. \u201cThey also have the nicest people that work there; you can ask questions and watch webinars. They do their best to educate you on how to use the website.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But it\u2019s no magic bullet, she cautions. \u201cYou need to learn how to use the site and how to work the contacts,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<h2>Just for Newbies<\/h2>\n<p>The best advice Schlott received as a rookie was that there\u2019s enough business for everyone. \u201cYou\u2019re not in an adversarial position with other agents,\u201d Schlott continues. \u201cSome agents forget that,\u201d she said. \u201cThose agents are your associates, not your adversaries<strong>\u2014<\/strong>they\u2019re the ones who are going to sell your listings.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>She also wants to warn new agents that what they learn to pass the real estate exam has nothing to do with the day-to-day practice of real estate. Schlott suggests that new agents take any continuing education classes that come along, and she highly recommends the GRI classes. \u201cThe GRI classes taught me more about doing business than anything else. They were a really big help to me.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>The Best Part of Working in Real Estate<\/h2>\n<p>Schlott\u2019s favorite aspect of her career is the ability to be an independent contractor. \u201cI enjoy most that I am right now sitting in my own house, in my office, setting my own hours,\u201d she explained. \u201cI go to work by getting up in the morning, making some coffee and walking into my office.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s true of a lot of people in this business that we\u2019re control freaks and we don\u2019t always play well with others,\u201d Schlott continued. \u201cI would die in the typical office situation, I really would.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>There <em>Is<\/em> Life Outside of Real Estate<\/h2>\n<p>We asked Schlott what she enjoys doing when she isn\u2019t working.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI enjoy golfing, I enjoy travelling,\u201d she replied. In fact, Schlott has her next trip planned: A two-week African safari.<\/p>\n<p>Schlott see herself as semi-retired a decade from now. \u201cOld Realtors\u00ae die hard,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going to be 80 years old and still driving clients around. I\u2019ll probably scare them and they\u2019re going to offer to drive me around,\u201d she said, laughing.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Jo Ann Schlott spent her entire life living just outside of Detroit before she decided to follow the sunshine and move to Arizona.
