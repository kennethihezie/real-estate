It also had a chilling effect on the housing market.

Here are some solid indicators why:<\/p>\n<h3>1. U.S. Home Construction Is Building Speed<\/h3>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.commerce.gov\/\">Commerce Department<\/a>, home construction increased sharply in July. Housing starts were up nearly 16 percent compared to the previous month. Compared to a year-ago period, housing starts jumped 22 percent.<\/p>\n<p>The South fared especially well and registered big gains in both single and multifamily construction. Overall, multifamily construction was strong across the nation.<\/p>\n<p>In July, at an annual rate of 1.093 million units, housing starts recorded the highest reading\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2014\/08\/20\/business\/for-home-depot-a-spring-rebound-and-a-better-year-ahead.html?_r=0\">since November<\/a>. Single family starts spiked 8.3 percent reached a rate of 656,000. The rate for multifamily housing was 423,000 \u2013 that\u2019s the strongest showing since 2006.<\/p>\n<p>It looks like there\u2019s no sign of stopping: Last month, building permits,\u00a0an indicator of future construction projects, jumped 8.1 percent compared to the prior month. Tom Showalter, chief analytics officer at Digital Risk, which provides mortgage services and risk analytics to lenders, said the economy has to continue to grow and job improvements are also crucial to keep the recovery momentum going in the market.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Home Depot Sees a Strong Quarter<\/h3>\n<p>With construction picking up, the fortunes of Home Depot are also on the rise, due to the improved housing market. America\u2019s largest home improvement retailer saw an increase in sales for big-ticket products such as appliances, windows and water heaters. According to the New York Times article, the company reported a big increase among its large clients, too.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe believe, in many ways, it\u2019s because of housing, and the fact that housing, while not as robust as last year, continues to recover,\u201d Carol B. Tom\u00e9, Home Depot\u2019s chief financial officer, told the Times of the company\u2019s strong results.<\/p>\n<p>Home Depot reported earnings of $2.05 billion in the second quarter, or $1.52 a share. That\u2019s up from $1.8 billion in the same quarter\u00a0last year. Revenue jumped 5.7 percent to $23.81 billion, up from $22.52 billion last year.<\/p>\n<p>Comparable store sales also jumped 6.4 percent in the U.S. The company\u2019s shares increased 4 percent on Tuesday, following the result. Both the Home Depot and the U.S. construction numbers surpassed analysts\u2019 expectations.<\/p>\n<h2>All-Cash Deals Still Popular Among U.S. Homebuyers<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright  wp-image-38501\" title=\"cash deals real estate\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/cash-deals-real-estate-300x205.jpg\" alt=\"All cash deals are still popular among U.S. homebuyers\" width=\"240\" height=\"164\" \/><\/p>\n<p>According to RealtyTrac, all-cash deals are still popular in U.S. real estate. In the second quarter, all-cash deals made up 38 percent of all home sales. Although down from 42 percent the previous quarter, that\u2019s still a huge number.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s bringing the number down is that some investors are finding fewer deals in the market. It\u2019s a circular trend. When the market was down and under, cash buyers descended to its rescue. But, as they competed against each other and individual buyers, they consumed much of the inventory. That led to increased demand and began driving up prices. In some places, property values have increased so much that even investors have started shying away.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s both good and bad news, Daren Blomquist, a spokesman for RealtyTrac, told CNNMoney. The good news is that first-time homebuyers may have a better chance, he said. The bad news is that some of them may be \u201cpriced out of the market.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>Photo courtesy of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/greatvalleycenter\/38286807\">Great Valley Center<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Winter\u2019s Chill on Housing Market Ends With Rise in Construction This past winter was one the\u00a0coldest in memory for most of the country.
