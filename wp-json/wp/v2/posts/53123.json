Others put that figure near 95 percent. Suffice to say, most new agents quit during the early years of their practice.<\/p>\n<p>Why is the attrition rate so high? More important, what can you do to avoid becoming a real estate churn rate statistic?<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Banish unrealistic expectations.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>From the outside looking in, the life of a real estate agent seems ideal \u2013 the perfect blend of a flexible schedule and a hefty salary. The allure of this easy money prompts far too many to run to their nearest real estate school to take the classes necessary to get their state\u2019s sales license.<\/p>\n<p>Among the many aspects of the industry that they fail to understand is that real estate agents are small business owners. Sure, they\u2019ll hang their licenses with a broker, but the rest of \u201cbeing a real estate agent\u201d is all up to the individual.<\/p>\n<p>That flexible schedule? In a sense, that outside perspective holds true.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>A new agent\u2019s schedule is Gumbyesque \u2013 bendable, pliable and infinitely flexible. <\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>There is no boss to dictate working hours, tasks that must be completed or when to take a vacation. The broker doesn\u2019t care what her agents do or when \u2013 if they\u2019re making money.<\/p>\n<p>Starting a business is hard work and entails long hours- yes, that means working evenings and weekends. The truth is, the traditional, Monday through Friday, 9-to-5 employee probably has more flexibility in his or her schedule than the rooky real estate agent. At least a rooky agent with a drive to succeed.<\/p>\n<p>Then, there are those big bucks that so many people outside of the industry assume agents bank. While it\u2019s an old inside joke that 20 percent of agents do 80 percent of the business, it holds some truth.<\/p>\n<p>The latest NAR Member Survey revealed that 24 percent of members make less than $10,000 and an equal number make more than $100,000. The rest of them earn a salary that falls somewhere in-between.<\/p>\n<p>To put this in perspective, 76 percent of agents make less than $100,000 a year and agents with two years or less experience had a median gross income of $8,930.<\/p>\n<p>The good news is, there are ways to beat these odds.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>You\u2019ll need a stash of cash.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>A lack of a steady income is the main reason agents give for leaving the business (Ferry, 2014). Real estate is a long-term game that requires substantial planning and preparation. You\u2019ll need to build a nest egg to live off before the commission checks come rolling in.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll also need some upfront cash for startup costs.<\/p>\n<p>The licensing sequence starts with real estate school. Then you\u2019ll need to apply to take the state licensing exam. When you pass the exam, you\u2019ll need to apply for the state license and, in some cases, submit background information and fingerprints.<\/p>\n<p>Once licensed, you\u2019ll need to hang the license with a broker. This is when you really start hemorrhaging money.<\/p>\n<p>Most brokers require membership in the National Association of Realtors (NAR). To obtain membership, however, you must also join the local and state associations and the local MLS.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to sell real estate in Riverside, California. You\u2019ll need to join the local, state and national association (standard in all areas), pay your MLS dues, a one-time MLS Security Fee and a New Member Orientation Fee.<\/p>\n<h4>These fees can be substantially less if you join in December than if you join in January so research pricing ahead of time to potentially save some money.<\/h4>\n<p>Ok, so you have your license and you\u2019ve joined necessary associations- some brokerages will ask you for an errors and omissions insurance fee. Coldwell Banker requires either an annual payment or $235.00 per month.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, there are smaller incidental outlays for things such as business cards, signs, and marekting.<\/p>\n<h4>Startup fees are estimated to be between $1500-2000 (Investopedia, 2017).<\/h4>\n<p>Be sure to look into your local and state fees so you\u2019re able to budget accordingly.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Choose your broker carefully.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Most of us can recall how challenging it was to decide which office we wanted to work out of and not knowing anyone in the business in your town makes it even more difficult. It\u2019s a pity because seasoned real estate agents have plenty insight to offer.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>\u201cThe people you surround yourself with in the beginning is critical. Having people that are going to support you, help you grow, and be your cheerleader is just huge \u2026 It\u2019s a tough business. You get a lot of rejection. You kind of need that positive strength behind you.\u201d &#8211;\u00a0<a href=\"\/blog\/agent-spotlight-laurie-weston-davis-of-pinehurst-nc\/\">Laurie Davis<\/a><\/h4>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>My first broker wouldn\u2019t let me work with clients until I could read both the listing and purchase agreement upside down.<\/p>\n<p>His reasoning for this is that I would be sitting across the table from the buyer or seller and, when they asked questions, I would need to recognize which part of the contract they were pointing at.<\/p>\n<h4>New-agent training is the foundation for your new business, so make this criterion a priority.<\/h4>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>\u201cListen very carefully and ask a lot of questions.\u201d &#8211;<a href=\"https:\/\/desty.kw.com\/\">Desty Lorino<\/a>, Coldwell Banker<\/h4>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h6>Basic considerations when choosing a broker include:<\/h6>\n<ul>\n<li>How does the broker market the brokerage? Look for signs, ads and check the website.<\/li>\n<li>What type of training is offered to the new agent?<\/li>\n<li>Technology \u2013 will you be asked to supply your own or will the broker supply you with an office computer and software?<\/li>\n<li>Who else works under the broker (you\u2019ll need a mentor and supportive colleagues).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You\u2019ll also want to know what your split of the commission will be, but this shouldn\u2019t be a condition for choosing a broker \u2013 at least not when you\u2019re new.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Create a plan.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>All new businesses benefit from a business plan. A business plan is a map of how you\u2019ll reach your income goals. It\u2019s important to note that business plans aren\u2019t static and require fine-tuning as you move up in your real estate career.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some great resources to help you get started:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"\/blog\/2017-real-estate-business-planning-essentials\/\">Market Leader\u2019s Real Estate Business Planning Essentials<\/a> Webinar<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/success.marketleader.com\/l\/42972\/2016-10-07\/5dx62t\">2017 Real Estate Business Plan<\/a> with free downloads of worksheets, marketing guides and samples<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/blog\/realestatebusiness\/\">How to stand out and position your business in real estate<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.inman.com\/2016\/01\/06\/7-must-haves-real-estate-marketing-plan\/\">Inman<\/a> offers additional marketing resources<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><strong>Additional considerations<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>There is a plethora of reasons new agents don\u2019t go the distance, but it\u2019s important to note that most of them come down to unrealistic expectations, a lack of planning, or both. If you\u2019re serious about getting your career off the ground, starting your journey with the right expectations and tools will make the world of difference. It can be done, but it takes work.<\/p>\n<p>Some priceless advice to heed:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Watch your mind set: You are no longer an employee, but a small business owner. Self-motivation is key.<\/li>\n<li>Don\u2019t spend all your time chasing buyers: \u201cList to last\u201d is a phrase you\u2019ll hear a lot. \u201cGo into nearly any real estate office in North America during any kind of market, ask to meet the top producer, and the odds are you\u2019ll soon be shaking the hand of someone whose income comes mostly from listing,\u201d warns Matt Williams in Realtor Mag.<\/li>\n<li>You simply must find a mentor. The benefits of someone else\u2019s experience are incalculable. \u201cFind a mentor; somebody that knows what he or she is doing, is successful and who is willing to teach you,\u201d insists Dano Sayles of RE\/MAX Lifestyle, Maui.<\/li>\n<li>Don\u2019t treat setbacks as the end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it. Michael Jordan was cut from his high school basketball team. \u201cI have failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed,\u201d he said. Remember: about 60 percent of sales take place after a prospect says \u201cno\u201d at least four times, according to Dirk Zeller.<\/li>\n<li>Load up on tech as soon as possible. \u201cGet a good contact management database \u2026 learn everything you can about it \u2013 how it works and what it can do for you. That database will be the one thing that\u2019s gonna make you a lot of money in the future,\u201d suggests Robert Russell, broker\/owner of Robert J. Russell Real Estate in Dallas. Laurie Davis agrees: \u201cHaving the website, the CRM and all of the things you\u2019ll need in place from the start is important,\u201d she says.<\/li>\n<li>Get involved in the community. Rub shoulders, cultivate relationships, take names and business cards. Community involvement shows not only your commitment to the community you serve, but helps to build your sphere of influence too.<\/li>\n<li>Failures don\u2019t answer their phones, don\u2019t return calls quickly and don&#8217;t follow up.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Even if you\u2019re doing everything right, the ca-ca may hit the fan. Keep in mind these wise words of an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RealEstate\/comments\/40iv5i\/why_i_quite_my_real_estate_job_an_open_letter_to\/\">11-year veteran<\/a> of the real estate industry: \u201cevery year I am guaranteed at least one full blown existential crisis where I threaten to throw it all away.
