Your domain will drive more clicks if you are clear about what services and information you provide.<\/p>\n<p><strong>It\u2019s Your Brand.<\/strong> You\u2019re probably putting your domain on all your print materials\u2014which is a best practice. People will then need to type your domain into a browser, and that means your domain is part of your business\u2019s identity, just like your logo.<\/p>\n<p><strong>It\u2019s Part of Your Lead Generation System.<\/strong> If you\u2019re looking to grow your business online, your website must be geared toward generating leads that you can convert into clients. Your domain helps bring people to your site, and then your site encourages and enables them to provide you with their contact information. All the pieces must work together for you to close more business.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u2026And Why It\u2019s Not Important\u2026<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Some people think you need to include keywords in your domain to make sure it appears high in the search results on search engines like Google, Yahoo, and Bing. While having a keyword rich domain may have its merits in some circumstances\u2014when it comes to search ranking, <strong>your website\u2019s content matters much more than the domain name<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Nevertheless, it\u2019s people\u2014not search engines\u2014who decide which link to click on. Make sure your domain is one that helps you grow your business.<\/p>\n<p><em>Aldona Clottey is Senior Director of Product Management at Market Leader.\u00a0 In this role, Aldona oversees Market Leader\u2019s product planning and strategy.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When it comes to generating website visitors and leads from your website without placing paid search ads, your website address, or \u201cdomain,\u201d is an essential part of your success.
