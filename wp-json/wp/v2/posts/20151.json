According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bizjournals.com\/austin\/blog\/morning_call\/2013\/07\/austin-named-one-of-americas.html\">Travel and Leisure<\/a> magazine, Austin is a snobby city. The editors claim that the city gives off a \u201cbrainy, offbeat vibe,\u201d but Christine Pura, of Keller Williams <a href=\"https:\/\/www.realtor.com\/realestateagents\/56cd55bd89a68901006f8735\">Austin Real Estate Team<\/a>, has another opinion.<\/p>\n<p>Pura thinks Austin gained the snobby moniker because of its transient nature. \u201cWe have about 120 people moving here a day from outside of Texas,\u201d she said, \u201cso Texas can\u2019t be blamed for this snotty attitude.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>They are coming from everywhere, these newly minted Austinites. Pura has sold homes to folks from Thailand, Iraq, and, of course, California, Nevada and Colorado.<\/p>\n<p>Decidedly un-snobby, Pura nonetheless responded to the lure of Austin and set down roots. \u201cI like the weather, I like the people, I like the prices\u2014it\u2019s cheap and affordable,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<h2>History<\/h2>\n<p>Before attending seven different high schools, Pura began life in San Francisco. \u201cMy family owned a bar and restaurant on Fisherman\u2019s Wharf\u2014the first one there to feature live entertainment,\u201d she said. The family also lived in Sacramento, Seattle and Texas.<\/p>\n<p>With dreams of someday becoming a veterinarian, Pura ended up a widow who supported her children by simultaneously holding down three jobs while still getting the kids to and from school and even attending their sporting events.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI never received a penny of government assistance,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI worked for Wells Fargo Bank and Bank of America and held two office manager jobs, all at the same time.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At Wells Fargo she started out as a teller, then a personal banker, then a loan officer, finally helping them launch the home equity product line.<\/p>\n<h2>The Lure of Real Estate and Self-Employment<\/h2>\n<p>Pura left Wells Fargo when they bailed Wachovia out of bankruptcy. \u201cMy boss got replaced and I got really irritated,\u201d she said. Pura went to real estate school at night while she trained her boss\u2019 replacement. When she finished real estate classes, she left banking and hung her real estate license with Keller Williams.<\/p>\n<p>Until this past June, Pura\u2019s business partner was her daughter. \u201cShe\u2019s my favorite female on the planet,\u201d Pura said. Now Mom is starting a solo career, building a new team.<\/p>\n<h2>The Austin Real Estate Team<\/h2>\n<p>Aside from Pura, who handles all the listings, the Austin Real Estate Team consists of three buyers\u2019 specialists and a client service specialist who is \u201c kind of the liaison between the buyer\u2019s agent and the client,\u201d Pura said. Keeping it all together is the team\u2019s office manager.<\/p>\n<p>We asked Pura about how she markets both her team and her listings. \u201cHow <em>don\u2019t <\/em>I market my business?\u201d she asked. \u201cWe have 900 syndicated real estate websites, like Zillow, Realtor.com, Homes.com, and TexasRealEstate.com. You name it. We populate our listings into all 900 search engines.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>She is also a big fan of Craigslist and YouTube. \u201cI don\u2019t know where we don\u2019t market,\u201d she said. \u201cWe market extensively.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Tools Make the Woman<\/h2>\n<p>Someone who markets as extensively as Pura must have some amazing tools to keep her organized and on track. We asked her about her must-have technology.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI hate Top Producer passionately,\u201d Pura explained. \u201cMarket Leader Business Suite\u2019s powerful CRM system simplifies and streamlines my communication and keeps clients coming back.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u201c<\/strong>My biggest challenge in my career right now is finding the perfect customer relationship management tool for teams,\u201d she says. She knows exactly what she wants, but it doesn\u2019t exist\u2014yet. She is toying with the idea of building it herself, with the help of a tech-minded friend.<\/p>\n<h2>R&amp;R<\/h2>\n<p>When she isn\u2019t working or dreaming of technological breakthroughs, Pura enjoys riding one of her four horses or hitting the links in Austin for a round of golf.<\/p>\n<p>Going into her 25th year of sobriety, Pura gives back to the community by counseling women who are recovering from alcoholism.<\/p>\n<p>We asked Pura where she sees herself a decade from now.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u201c<\/strong>In a 6-foot box,\u201d she said, chuckling. Getting serious, she adds, \u201cI\u2019ll still be running my business, probably more passively. I will always be selling real estate. In 10 years I\u2019ll be less hands-on, and I\u2019ll just be working with my past clients and referrals, but I\u2019ll never get out of the business\u2014I love it.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Don\u2019t let the \u201cKeep Austin Weird\u201d mantra fool you.
