But while that\u2019s true at least to some extent, it\u2019s also about influencing people and building relationships. That\u2019s why the most effective agents are connected to a wide network and they know how to use it to generate leads.<\/p>\n<p>But it takes time to find real estate leads for new agents. And whether you\u2019re starting out or starting over, that can be frustrating.<\/p>\n<p>Just because you\u2019re a new real estate agent doesn\u2019t mean you have to blaze your own trail. There\u2019s a well-worn path to follow. Let\u2019s take a look at some tried-and-true lead generation tips that will set you on the trajectory toward career-long success.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">How to Generate Leads Through Direct Outreach<\/h2>\n<p>The simplest and most obvious place for new agents to get real estate leads is within their own current sphere of influence. Even though you won\u2019t be able to rely solely on your inner circle of connections to generate leads for your entire career, it can provide the open doors you need to get started. There are many ways to market yourself without feeling \u201csalesy\u201d\u2014here are just a few:<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">Let friends and family know you can help.<\/h3>\n<p>For every new agent, the odds are high that someone who is part of your family or friend group is currently thinking about selling or buying. If not, they probably know someone who is.<\/p>\n<p>Make sure it\u2019s your name that\u2019s fresh on their mind. Due to the nature of these kinds of relationships, there\u2019s less of a need to pitch. Usually, simply mentioning that you\u2019re in real estate will be enough to open the kind of conversation that results in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/blog\/real-estate-marketing-ideas-for-referrals-repeat-business\/\">getting more referral leads<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">Turn to your wider social circles.<\/h2>\n<p>Think about all of the clubs, organizations, teams, and religious communities that are part of your life. They all fit within your network, and they all present opportunities for you to spread the word about your new profession.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s safe to assume that someone who is connected to you through a shared interest would feel more comfortable working with you than a stranger.<\/p>\n<p>How to Generate Leads Through Digital Outreach<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">Be your own content creator.<\/h3>\n<p>People are hungry for accurate, thoughtful real estate advice that\u2019s specific to their city or zip code. Of course they see the headlines about nationwide housing market trends. But what they need is a source of reliable information that pertains to their specific area.<\/p>\n<p>This is where you come in.<\/p>\n<p>As a new agent, you have something very valuable that the veteran agents don\u2019t have: time. And you can leverage that asset by becoming the one who provides insight, advice, and information about local market trends for your prospects.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe for you that looks like writing compelling blog content or creating captivating infographics. Maybe you also focus on alerting leads about the prices of just-sold listings or every highly-desirable home that comes on the market. However it works out for you, amassing a body of high quality, useful information that speaks directly to your audience is one of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/blog\/how-to-get-real-estate-listings\/\">best ways for new real estate agents to get leads<\/a>. (Don\u2019t forget to use city-specific hashtags on your social media channels!)<\/p>\n<p>Consider partnering with a local influencer on a home sale.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll eventually have your own following. But in the meantime, consider connecting with local influencers who already have a large network\u2014for example, radio personalities, social media influencers, or prominent business owners. Ask them if they\u2019re thinking of purchasing. Offer a deal where, for example, you reduce your commission fees in exchange for marketing plugs.<\/p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbescommunicationscouncil\/2020\/09\/08\/the-power-word-of-mouth-has-in-marketing-and-how-to-cultivate-it\/?sh=50e02103df02\">one study<\/a>, 63% of consumers between 18 and 34 trust what influencers say about brands more than they trust what a brand says about itself. (With Millennials making up the largest share of home buyers according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nar.realtor\/research-and-statistics\/research-reports\/home-buyer-and-seller-generational-trends#:~:text=Some%20of%20the%20findings%20this,than%20a%20first%2Dtime%20buyer\">NAR<\/a>, that&#8217;s huge.) And brands that leverage micro-influencers can see a sales increase of up to 18%.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">How to Get Leads Through Business Partnerships<\/h2>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">Develop a friendship with local businesses.<\/h3>\n<p>Small businesses love referrals. And so do you! It\u2019s a win-win.<\/p>\n<p>How do new real estate agents partner with local businesses to generate leads? It\u2019s actually simple.<\/p>\n<p>Make a list of businesses you want to work with. There\u2019s no wrong answer here. It could include a veterinarian office, health-food store, coffee shop, pet groomer, laundromat\u2026 you get the idea.<\/p>\n<p>Then go through your list and ask the owner if they\u2019d be willing to allow you to display some marketing materials and business cards at their spot. Tell them that, in return, you\u2019ll refer your clients to their business, feature them on your website, or that you\u2019ll include them in your client \u201cwelcome packet\u201d full of your best recommendations and local favorites.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">Form partnerships in related fields.<\/h3>\n<p>While you\u2019re thinking of local businesses, be sure to pay close attention to those that are related in some way to real estate. For example: moving companies, brokers, insurance agents, lawyers, and interior designers.<\/p>\n<p>For more ideas, think of your prospects\u2019 buying and selling journey and all of the various types of professionals they\u2019ll interact with along the way. You\u2019ll help them. They\u2019ll help you.<\/p>\n<p>Word-of-mouth marketing continues to be one of the most influential marketing tools across all industries. And that\u2019s especially true for new real estate agents.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">Get Leads by Targeting Rentals<\/h2>\n<p>Targeting for-rent-by-owner (FRBO) properties can be a way to generate leads for new agents too. It\u2019s not the same as getting a lead to sell a home. But finding renters can be great practice for a budding real estate agent. And once you do, you\u2019ll likely come across landlords who are beyond interested to hear what you can offer!<\/p>\n<p>Plus, as a side benefit, you\u2019ll begin to form relationships with the landlords. And because you\u2019re top-of-mind, chances are high that you\u2019ll be the agent they work with if they decide to sell or if the tenant decides to buy.<\/p>\n<p>This can be an advantage for new agents because seasoned agents tend to ignore renters. Consider making this your niche. Use a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/products\/professional-for-agents\/\">robust real estate marketing automation tool<\/a> to create a newsletter just for renters that provides updates on local housing trends. Include things like snapshots of recent sales, listing updates, reasons why now is a great time to buy, and information on new developments in the area.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">Host the Best Open House Ever<\/h2>\n<p>Most open houses feature a cheese plate, a few nosy neighbors, and a bored agent. But it doesn\u2019t have to be that way.<\/p>\n<p>Once you land a listing, make a splash: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/blog\/5-ways-to-maximize-open-houses\/\">Host an amazing open house.<\/a> First, create impressive invitations and send them to the whole neighborhood. Next, make sure the food and ambiance are on point. In addition to potentially attracting a buyer on the spot, a big benefit here is that everyone in the neighborhood is going to remember you \u2013 \u201cthat amazing agent\u201d \u2013 when it\u2019s time to sell.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">Get Leads by Following up on Major Life Events<\/h2>\n<p>This one takes some detective work, and it may not work for every community. But the idea is to see if your local newspaper has an announcement column and to use that as a way to forecast potential leads.<\/p>\n<p>Reach out to the couples who were recently married or became engaged and see if they\u2019re interested in purchasing a home. Marriages often lead to children, which may require upsizing.<\/p>\n<p>And you could do the same for any retirement or high school graduation announcements you find, too. Because retirement can sometimes lead to a move, and you could be the agent who helps them find their paradise. When high school graduates leave the nest, downsizing often follows.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">Pay for Leads<\/h2>\n<p>The best way for new real estate agents to get leads is to buy them. This isn\u2019t a last-ditch effort for the desperate. It\u2019s very common. Most agents use paid leads. And it can be extremely difficult for new agents to gain traction without doing so.<\/p>\n<p>Market Leader offers <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/products\/real-estate-leads\/\">two real estate leads products<\/a> to help you reach your gross commission income goal.
