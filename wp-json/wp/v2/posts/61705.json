To give you an idea of what to expect, here\u2019s a sketch of some of the concepts covered in the full guide.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">What Is a Real Estate Marketing Plan?<\/h2>\n<p>A real estate marketing plan is an organized collection of strategies, systems, and schedules that individual agents, teams, and brokerages use to guide their marketing efforts.<\/p>\n<p>Every marketing plan for real estate must incorporate the five essential components listed below.<\/p>\n<p>Which (if any) do you already have in place?<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">A Brand Structure<\/h3>\n<p>If you have a weak brand, you\u2019re more likely to lose focus, disappear in the crowd of competition, and misrepresent who you are as an agent. All of which reduces productivity and hinders your ability to acquire and retain quality leads.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH3\">Data &amp; Analytics<\/h2>\n<p>When you\u2019re armed with statistics, analytics, and insights, you\u2019re better able to set goals, track progress, and make your success repeatable. Without data, your marketing efforts are more likely to be a complete gamble, if not a guessing game.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">An Understanding of Consumers\u2019 New Expectations<\/h3>\n<p>Service providers of all kinds are constantly adjusting the way they do business to keep up with changes in technology, tactics, and trends. Are you aware of what prospects and clients expect of you as a real estate agent? If not, you risk falling to the background.<\/p>\n<p>For example, most of today\u2019s consumers expect prompt communication via text message. In a <a href=\"https:\/\/cdn.nar.realtor\/sites\/default\/files\/documents\/2022-home-buyers-and-sellers-generational-trends-03-23-2022.pdf\">2022 report from the National Association of Realtors<\/a> (NAR), 71% of buyers said it was \u201cimportant\u201d to receive property information and communication from their agent via text message. Whereas in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nar.realtor\/sites\/default\/files\/reports\/2015\/2015-home-buyer-and-seller-generational-trends-2015-03-11.pdf\">2015<\/a> \u2013 just seven years earlier \u2013 that figure was only 45%.<\/p>\n<p>Consumers expectations change fast, and you need to keep up.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">Social Proof<\/h3>\n<p>Speaking of what consumers want, near the top of the list is authentic proof of your competency, especially in the form of reviews and testimonials. In what ways could you add social proof to your marketing efforts? Common ways for agents include requesting reviews on their Facebook pages or Zillow profiles.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">Technology &amp; Tools<\/h3>\n<p>The best real estate marketing plans include a social media strategy, video content, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/solutions\/marketing-automation\/\">robust marketing automation tools<\/a>, a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/solutions\/customizable-websites\/\">customizable real estate website<\/a>, and a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/solutions\/crm\/\">fully-integrated CRM<\/a>.

And maybe you\u2019ve already established goals, but you\u2019re not seeing the results you want.<\/p>\n<p>The reason may be that they\u2019re not SMART goals: smart, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound.<\/p>\n<p>This approach enables you to set realistic goals while also increasing the likelihood that you\u2019ll actually achieve them.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">3 Examples of SMART Goals<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><em>\u201cI will increase the average number of leads I generate every month by 20 percent by the end of 2023.\u201d<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em>\u201cI will attend one webinar or download one guide about lead generation best practices every month throughout 2023.\u201d<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em>\u201cI will 1) research which real estate website provider has the best websites for generating leads and 2) implement a new website from that provider by the end of the first quarter.\u201d<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Want a full breakdown of each part of the acronym so you can start setting results-producing goals today? <a style=\"font-weight: 800;\" href=\"#download\">Get our free interactive marketing planning guide.<\/a><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">5 Must-Have Real Estate Marketing Strategies<\/h2>\n<p>Goals are worthless if you don\u2019t have specific strategies in place to help you reach them.
