Customer service is everything these days\u2014it can make or break your business. We all know the Big Mantras: going the extra mile, adding a personal touch\u2026 those are so important\u2014and so well understood\u2014that I won\u2019t repeat them. \u00a0So my answer is this:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sometimes you just have to step aside and get out of your customers\u2019 way.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Let me explain. Market Leader started out using the Internet in an innovative way to create local leads during a time when the Internet\u2019s abilities to target geography were primitive at best. We found a way to enable consumers to first engage with us (through TV ad campaigns), and then we would introduce them to a local expert\u2014the real estate agent. We worked to make sure that handoff was seamless, that the consumer felt comfortable with the entire process.<\/p>\n<p>As web technologies advanced, we gained the ability to help consumers engage directly with the real estate professional from the start. It\u2019s easier for consumers to understand\u2014because that\u2019s what they expect\u2014and it\u2019s easier for the real estate professional to do his or her job. That\u2019s the bottom line: to provide the best customer service experience, especially as a business that helps small businesses, sometimes you have to disappear and let your customer shine.<\/p>\n<p><em>Scott Smith is Vice President of Sales and Business Strategy driving operational and business planning as well as product management for Market Leader. He also oversees Market Leader\u2019s sales and marketing efforts.
