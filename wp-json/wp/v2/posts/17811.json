I\u2019ll tell you how Brian Bendily answered that request later on. After getting to know him myself, though, I would say there are two words: honest and enchanting.<\/p>\n<p>From his charming Southern accent to his fearless candor, Brian Bendily of Keller Williams in Monroe, La. is an enchanting man. Read on and see if you agree with me.<\/p>\n<h2>Troubles in Small-Town America<\/h2>\n<p>Bendily grew up in what he calls small-town America. \u201cI was born and raised in the same town I still live in,\u201d he tells us.<\/p>\n<p>Bendily comes from an upper-middle-class family that provided him with a \u201cvery loving home. I struggled in school big time, though,\u201d he admits. \u201cI couldn\u2019t focus, and that was my biggest challenge. I tried to deflect and hung out with a crowd that was like me \u2013 other kids not doing good in school,\u201d he continues.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAt some point I started to reflect the behavior of the people that I was around. Therefore, because of that behavior, I never had teachers who believed in me,\u201d Bendily considers.<\/p>\n<p>Although he later obtained his GED, a combination of struggles with his classes and the temptations of his peers caused him to fail the ninth grade, so he quit school. \u201cCome to find out later, I had ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder).\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Bendily took on various small jobs after leaving school. \u201cI worked with a guy that did arts and crafts, and we\u2019d travel around to shows, selling the things he made. I then washed dishes in a restaurant,\u201d he continues. The restaurant closed down, however, and Bendily was laid off.<\/p>\n<p>He says he recalls feeling, at this time, as if he needed to fight for everything he wanted. \u201cAs I get older, I sit back and think that the battles I fought in the past were against myself. I\u2019ve learned I don\u2019t have to fight for everything,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe\u2019re always told that hard work will get us where we need to be. It\u2019s not necessarily hard work that will get you there, it\u2019s smart work,\u201d he concludes.<\/p>\n<h2>Providence<\/h2>\n<p>It just so happened that one of Bendily\u2019s neighbors did some computer work for the local Coca-Cola bottling plant and got him a job interview there. He got the job.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI started working graveyard for Coca-Cola, in a low position,\u201d he says. \u201cI was stacking trays and unloading trucks. I was able to advance into the lab where we actually made the Coke. From there I advanced into inventory control as a clerk and then to an analyst,\u201d he explains.<\/p>\n<p>Not able to catch even a small break, Bendily\u2019s position with the beverage bottler was eliminated. What looked like yet another disappointment however, turned out to be a blessing.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey gave me three months\u2019 notice before my job was over and a three month\u2019s severance package,\u201d Bendily says. \u201cIt was enough time for me to explore other avenues.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The avenue he is thankful for exploring is real estate. A family friend explained that he was taking the real estate exam. Bendily thought working in real estate sounded appealing, so he took the real estate class. \u201cI passed the test the first time, and on January 1, 2006, I went to work for Coldwell Banker and started selling real estate.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Within his first 90 days Bendily had closed his first transaction. \u201cThe beautiful thing is, that was the same month my severance package from Coca-Cola ran out,\u201d he says, laughing.<\/p>\n<p>He went on to become Rookie of the Year his first year in real estate. In 2009, he moved to Keller Williams.<\/p>\n<h2>The Bendily Team<\/h2>\n<p>Bendily uses a virtual assistant to handle all of his marketing. \u201cOnce I got introduced to that path,\u201d he says, \u201cit just made everything blow up. My VA is like a machine; he is awesome at what he does,\u201d Bendily claims. The virtual assistant works four hours a day, generating leads for the team.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t tell him what time to work, I just tell him how many leads I want him to generate. I told him 200 leads a month is what we want, and he averages 180 to 200 every month,\u201d Bendily says.<\/p>\n<p>The rest of the team consists of himself, wife Karla, two buyer agents, another virtual assistant and Robin, his executive assistant.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cShe helps me keep grounded and pointed in the right direction, he says. \u201cI just recently hired a lead coordinator to help us increase our conversion ratio and our follow-up with the long-term business,\u201d Bendily adds.<\/p>\n<h2>Lead Generation, the Bendily Way<\/h2>\n<p>Initially, Bendily was drawn to the technology aspects of real estate. So much so that he neglected the first step that most new agents take &#8211; developing his sphere.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cProbably the weakest point of my business right now is working my sphere. I\u2019m just being transparent with you,\u201d he admits. \u201cBut it\u2019s something that we\u2019re building,\u201d he adds.<\/p>\n<p>The tool most critical to Bendily\u2019s success is his website. \u201cMy Market Leader website is the lead generating tool that gets me more business and keeps more money in my checking account than anything else that I\u2019ve utilized,\u201d Bendily claims.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOnce we started using the Market Leader platform, we were able to drop four other services costing $250.00 monthly, while gaining 42 percent more leads in 2012 than in 2011,\u201d he continues.<\/p>\n<p>Market Leader, he says, has provided him with \u201can all-in-one system that does everything for me, and it\u2019s so easy for us to use. If you put a little bit of work into it to set things up how you want them, and you put the right people in place to help you maintain them, it runs like a well-oiled machine.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Life is Great in Bendily\u2019s World<\/h2>\n<p>In what little spare time he has, Bendily enjoys spending time with his wife, Karla. Although he doesn\u2019t realize it now, he\u2019ll be grateful for this last bit of time alone they have. Come October, a month before the couple\u2019s third anniversary, they will become the parents of twin girls.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI have a 12-year-old daughter from a previous marriage, and I kind of thought I was through having kids,\u201d Bendily says. \u201cBut then Karla and I got married and we decided to adopt, and now I\u2019m 38 and have a set of newborn twins about to get in my house &#8211; and I couldn\u2019t be more happy,\u201d he says, chuckling.<\/p>\n<p>And his career?<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf anybody could say that they found their dream job \u2013 boy have I found my dream job! I love everything about it,\u201d Bendily exclaims. \u201cI love connecting with new people. I love working with first-time homebuyers and the sense of accomplishment and achievement I feel when I hand them that key,\u201d he concludes.<\/p>\n<p>I asked Bendily to give me a one-word description of himself and he couldn\u2019t come up with one. So I asked him to describe how he feels about his life right now.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m happy. I\u2019m happy. I\u2019m happy,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m ecstatic about the things that are happening. I feel so blessed.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>At the end of these &#8220;Agent Spotlight&#8221; interviews, I always ask the agent to give me a one-word description of themselves.
