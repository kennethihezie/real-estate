I know because I used to be one. As soon as one agent does something that proves to be even quasi-successful, it\u2019s rapidly copied until nearly everyone is doing it, and no one can quite remember why.<\/p>\n<p>Take selfie video blogs from the car for instance, invented by agent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/thecarolinasfinest\">Jessica Riffle Edwards<\/a>. These videos quickly became widely popular, and as more agents learned about them, they copied her.<\/p>\n<p>Today, dash cam videos are all over the Internet, produced by thousands of agents. The practice has become so abundant, in fact, that there\u2019s a Tumblr page devoted to it called <a href=\"https:\/\/realestateagentsincars.tumblr.com\/\">\u201cReal Estate Agents in Cars.\u201d<\/a> These videos are no longer unique, so they are really no longer interesting \u2013 and quite the contrary, consumers are even laughing at them.<\/p>\n<p>What other practices do masses of agents adhere to without really understanding why or what, if any, benefit they provide? Sadly, many agents don\u2019t seem to understand that a lot of times these fads may actually <em>harm<\/em> their business.<\/p>\n<p>Here are more three examples of real estate tropes that need to go away \u2013 for both agents\u2019 and the industry\u2019s sake.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Tired Taglines<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-43441\" title=\"cheesy real estate slogan\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/cheesy-real-estate-slogan-2-150x105.png\" alt=\"real estate slogans and taglines agents should use\" width=\"150\" height=\"105\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Some agents call them taglines while others refer to them as slogans. Many consumers call them \u201ccheesy.\u201d For an industry that tries so desperately to gain respect and lose the \u201cused car salesperson\u201d stigma, it\u2019s amazing that it still tenaciously clings to something that, if not done right, is smarmy.<\/p>\n<p>Take a look at your tagline: What does it do for your business? Does it motivate anyone to use your services? Does it differentiate you from the competition? Perhaps you think it captures people\u2019s attention or encapsulates your business philosophy.<\/p>\n<p>Those are the only reasons to use a tagline and if yours doesn\u2019t fit one of the above criteria, it is doing the opposite of each. Plus, like closing gifts, it\u2019s something only real estate agents do. Tell me the last time you saw an accountant\u2019s business card that contained a tagline. Does your doctor use a tagline? Your hairdresser? Somehow I don\u2019t think \u201cI Love to Do Taxes\u201d or \u201cYour Surgeon for Life\u201d would cut it.<\/p>\n<p>From silly taglines that make no sense other than that they play off an agent\u2019s name to the overused \u201cEverything I Touch Turns to SOLD\u201d or \u201cA REALTOR you Can Trust\u201d or \u201cI Love to Sell Real Estate\u201d \u2013 can we agree, please, that it\u2019s time to dump the taglines?<\/p>\n<h2>2. Cheesy Agent Photos<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright wp-image-43351 size-medium\" title=\"cheesy real estate photos\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/cheesy-real-estate-photos-239x300.jpg\" alt=\"An example of a cheesy real estate agent photo.\" width=\"239\" height=\"300\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The agent photo on a business card is such a tradition that, at this point, it is useless to debate whether or not it\u2019s effective.<\/p>\n<p>The best commentary on the topic, however, has to be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theonion.com\/i-wasnt-going-to-buy-this-house-until-i-saw-the-realtor-1819584626\">this story from The Onion<\/a>, the satirical news outlet, titled \u201cI Wasn&#8217;t Going To Buy This House Until I Saw The Realtor&#8217;s Headshot On The Sign.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And while it\u2019s useless to argue with agents who insist that their photo is the end-all, be-all when it comes to being recognized around town, the photo that they choose <em>is<\/em> debatable \u2013 and sometimes the source of ridicule from the general public.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s start with the awful headshot. Try this little experiment: Search online for \u201ccheesy real estate agent photos.\u201d Google returned more than 360,000 results, and just those on the first page will tell you how most people feel about your photos. There is even a Tumblr entitled \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/estateagents.tumblr.com\/\">Real Estate Agent Headshots<\/a>\u201d that is so real it hurts.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright wp-image-43361 size-medium\" title=\"cheesy real estate photos 2\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/cheesy-real-estate-photos-2-210x300.jpg\" alt=\"An example of a cheesy real estate agent photo.\" width=\"210\" height=\"300\" \/>If you simply must use a photo on your business card, here are a few tips:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use a professional photographer to get a professional-looking photo. You may think you look just too cute in that photo snapped at a nightclub, but it\u2019s not suitable for your professional identity. Nor are selfies.<\/li>\n<li>Update your photo at least once a decade \u2013 sooner, preferably.<\/li>\n<li>Consider your brand and how you want to come across. There\u2019s nothing wrong with a photo that shows you as humorous, creative, trendy, hip or even serious, as long as it fits your branding and the clients you hope to attract.<\/li>\n<li>Wear something appropriate for a business photo. This doesn\u2019t mean you need to wear a suit if you usually don\u2019t. Cleavage is inappropriate. Gauges in your ears are inappropriate (Yes, there is a headshot in which a 40-something agent not only has gauges, but spiked hair as well). Just use common sense.<\/li>\n<li>Ditch the props. Dogs, kids, telephones, real estate signs \u2013 just don\u2019t go there.<\/li>\n<li>Don\u2019t overuse Photoshop. If you\u2019re using your photo to be recognizable, air brushing until you no longer look like yourself is just silly.<\/li>\n<li>Don\u2019t pose. Relax and smile instead.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>3. Terrible Listing Photos<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-39291 size-medium\" title=\"awful real estate photography\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/awful-real-estate-photography-300x223.png\" alt=\"Using a low-quality camera will result in terrible real estate listing photos\" width=\"300\" height=\"223\" \/>Since we\u2019re on the subject of photos, isn\u2019t it time to get rid of <a href=\"\/blog\/lessons-from-the-worst-real-estate-photographers\/\">awful listing photos<\/a>? The trend is perpetuated by a small minority of agents who give a bad name to the profession.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m referring to blurry photos, sideways photos, and photos that make viewers scratch their heads and ask \u201cWhy on earth would someone take a photo of that?\u201d or worse, \u201cWhat <em>IS<\/em> that?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Based on the median sales price, the median commission per transaction is a little over $5,600. There is simply no excuse for lousy listing photos when people will be paying you this amount to market and sell their homes. Get out your wallet and pay for a professional photographer if you aren\u2019t good at it.<\/p>\n<p>The sad truth is, real estate agents have a crummy reputation, right up there with used car salespersons. A few bad actors are responsible for creating this perception, yet the entire industry is tainted by it. And unfortunately, some of the stuff agents create to legitimize themselves actually shows very little imagination, and just digs the hole deeper<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a combination of knowledge, charisma and excellent customer service that will bring you clients and referrals from these clients. All the gimmicks in the world won\u2019t change that.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Agents: What real estate cliches would you like to get rid of?<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Real estate agents can display some lemming-esque qualities at times.
