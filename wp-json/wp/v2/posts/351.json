That\u2019s true whether it\u2019s called a \u201clead,\u201d \u201cprospect,\u201d \u201ccustomer-initiated contact\u201d, or any other name.<\/p>\n<p>No matter what you call them or where you get your leads from, they are necessary for your business to prosper and grow.\u00a0\u00a0 I have always advised our customers to constantly seek out more leads and then to treat them all equally.\u00a0 This is easy to do when technology does the hard work for you, by emailing listings to the contacts in your database. Technology builds the relationship until they have immediate need for your services and expertise. At that time, you\u2019re alerted when it\u2019s time for personal assistance\u2014that is, when the consumer signals they\u2019re ready.\u00a0\u00a0 This is when the lead becomes an \u201copportunity.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Because relationships are key in this industry, leads generated by yourself\u2014through your sphere or referrals, etc.\u2014are always going to have greater chances of yielding a transaction than those from a third-party. That\u2019s why Market Leader focuses on giving brokers and agents the tools to generate leads themselves\u2014<strong><em>through their own website<\/em><\/strong>. <\/p>\n<p>A consumer is naturally going to feel more comfortable being contacted when they know exactly who they are providing their information to. Today\u2019s technology makes it easy to build direct relationships between real estate professionals and consumers. And as long as technology continually offers new ways to do that, we\u2019ll continue to innovate on behalf of our customers.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A recent article by Michael Parker on RIS Media posed the question: \u201cIs It Time to Retire the Word \u2018Lead?\u2019\u201d The author made some interesting comments, concluding essentially: no, it\u2019s not time yet, but you need to define the word correctly.
