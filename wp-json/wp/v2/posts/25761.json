If you just want to improve your real estate newsletter&#8217;s open rate, on the other hand, create better subject lines.<\/p>\n<p>Think about your favorite magazine and what compels you to purchase it. Sure, the cover photo has a lot to do with it, but the headlines typically sell the magazine. Studies of online headlines for blog posts and other content also bear that out.<\/p>\n<p>Why, then do so many agents ignore the importance of the email\u2019s subject line, which is, in effect, its headline? Just like blog posts and articles, content that is being sent electronically deserves to be treated with decades of journalistic best practices and proven methods for success.<\/p>\n<p>That is, <em>if<\/em> you want people to read what you write.<\/p>\n<h2>Think of Subject Lines as Headlines<\/h2>\n<p>Think of the subject line of an email as the headline of the content within the email. It should be concise, descriptive and compelling. Yes, it\u2019s a big job for just a few words to accomplish.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the most effective subject lines have to do with helping, not selling. For instance, if your real estate newsletter contains stories about interest rates and home improvement projects, headlines like \u201c3 Ways to Increase your Home\u2019s Value\u201d or \u201cSpice up your Kitchen in 5 Easy Steps\u201d are much more enticing subject lines than \u201cWeekly Real Estate Newsletter\u201d or \u201cInterest Rates Drop.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Since numbered lists are one of the most popular forms of content, and <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/5-data-insights-into-the-headlines-readers-click\">numbered list headlines<\/a> \u2013 such as \u201c3 Steps to Win a Bidding War\u201d \u2013 get the most clicks, according to Nathan Safran at Moz, it only stands to reason that agents should consider using them in their email subject lines.<\/p>\n<p>Keep the list short. Although potential buyers may be looking for ways to raise their FICO scores, few will click on \u201c101 Ways to Improve your Credit Score.\u201d Shorten the list to five or seven ways and you may grab their interest.<\/p>\n<p>Abreena Tompkins, instruction specialist at Surry Community College, confirms this with the results of a meta-analysis of more than 300 articles. Her analysis finds that \u201cThe brain can process no more than nine items in a sequence, and it actually does this much more efficiently with three or five. Odd numbers work better than even numbers,\u201d Tompkins concludes. So, skip the \u201c50 Ways to Leave Your Money Pit\u201d and go with \u201c3 Amazingly Simple Tricks to Sell Your Home.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Moz study also finds that powerful adjectives in newsletter headlines get more clicks than the use of no adjectives. For instance, which menu item are you more likely to order \u2013 \u201ccheese omelet\u201d or \u201comelet of 3 freshly-cracked eggs loaded with tangy, smoked Vermont cheddar?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Consider using emotion-rich adjectives such as powerful, exciting, amazingly (simple), surprising, and startling, to name a few.<\/p>\n<p>Then, plug them into Safran\u2019s template: \u201c(odd number) (adjective) (mistakes\/tips\/insights\/shortcuts) for (achieving\/avoiding) (desired outcome\/disaster). The result for a real estate agent may be: \u201c3 Disastrous Homebuyer Mistakes.\u201d\u00a0 Number one is, of course, not hiring you as their agent.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t be hard on yourself if your open rate for your drip email or newsletter campaign isn\u2019t as high as you\u2019d like it to be. Concentrate more on beefing up the subject line and your stats will improve.<\/p>\n<p>Think of those few critical words as bait. They get your email recipients on the hook and lured in to the email\u2019s content and purpose. Whether that purpose is a specific call to action or merely to keep you top-of-mind, the headline is everything.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8220;If you want a 100 percent open rate, send one email to your mother,&#8221; says Dela Quist, CEO of Alchemy Worx.
