First impressions are vital, whether it\u2019s a house about to hit the market or a real estate agent about to hit a house. You only have a fraction of a second to make that impression.<\/p>\n<p>There is a fine line, however, between projecting a professional image and intimidating a client. How you straddle that line depends on the region, the customs within that region, your niche clientele, and good old common sense.<\/p>\n<h2>How Should Real Estate Agents Dress?<\/h2>\n<p>Folks have been pondering what to wear at least as far back as AD 95. \u201cTo dress within the formal limits and with an air gives men, as the Greek line testifies, authority,\u201d Quintilian penned in \u201cInstitutio Oratoria.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Shakespeare\u2019s Polonius warns his son that \u201cthe apparel oft proclaims the man.\u201d Contemporary thinkers agree, to a certain extent. \u201cClothes\u00a0make the man. Naked people have little or no influence on society,\u201d joked Mark Twain.<\/p>\n<p>Research has shown us that those first few seconds after meeting someone, the computer in our heads spins and whirs and spits out a judgment. Interestingly, although the judgment might be based on what the person is wearing, the impression is something entirely different.<\/p>\n<p>Ben C. Johnson, professor of occupational and health psychology at the University of Hertfordshire in the UK, performed a study to determine the ways in which clothing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/us\/blog\/do-something-different\/201304\/what-your-clothes-might-be-saying-about-you\">influences our impressions<\/a> of people.<\/p>\n<p>After only three seconds of viewing a picture of a man in a custom-made suit and another in an off-the-rack suit, test subjects formed their judgments. They rated the man in the custom-tailored suit as \u201cmore confident, successful, flexible and a higher earner,\u201d than when he wore the off-the-rack suit, according to Johnson.<\/p>\n<p>While many folks think that fashion is nothing more than an extravagant indulgence, and that a sunny disposition will overshadow an uninteresting wardrobe, Johnson disagrees. \u201cDressing to impress really is worthwhile and could even be the key to success,\u201d he claims.<\/p>\n<p>Before you freak out, thinking you need to wear custom-tailored suits to be successful in real estate, check this out:<\/p>\n<p>A 1986 study finds that \u201cconservative and casual clothing styles are more likely to portray a more reliable and self-controlled personality.\u201d Dressier clothing, on the other hand, conveyed an \u201cunfriendly personality and created a sense of unease in others.\u201d Sure, the study is two decades old, but when it\u2019s common to see people shopping at Wal-Mart in their jammies, it\u2019s a safe bet that folks still view casual attire favorably.<\/p>\n<p>Atlanta real estate agent Ann Bone has an easy approach when it comes to what to wear to meet clients. \u201cThe higher the price of the property, the higher the heel,\u201d she suggests.<\/p>\n<p><em>Watch this video to get some tips on how to dress from agent and San Francisco real estate fixture Herman Chan:<\/em><\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/NjEepQ1lUg0\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2>What Style of Car Should Agents Drive?<\/h2>\n<p>Real estate agents and cars \u2013 it\u2019s a hot topic whenever discussed. There seem to be two schools of thought among those in the industry when it comes to wheels:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>My car gives potential clients the impression that I am successful.<\/li>\n<li>All that matters is that whatever I drive is clean and reliable.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The first way of thinking assumes that real estate clients only want to work with mega-agents \u2013 the \u00fcber successful in the market. The second assumes that what we drive doesn\u2019t offer a first impression. Who is correct?<\/p>\n<p>If what we drive is a measurement of our success, and thus a reflection of our skills, why do many physicians in the U.S. <a href=\"https:\/\/averagedoctor.com\/what-type-of-car-do-doctors-drive\/\">drive Toyotas or Hondas rather than luxury cars?<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Why does Mark Zuckerberg drive an Acura, and fellow billionaire and co-founder of Facebook, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/the-vehicles-wealthy-techies-choose-to-drive-2012-7?op=1#ixzz2bJrY6Mhw\">Dustin Moskovits<\/a>, drive a Volkswagon hatchback?<\/p>\n<p>The same question can be asked of those to whom we entrust our hair, our pets, our finances and our teeth. Do you choose them by the car they drive? If your lawyer drove a 5-year-old Camry, would you ditch her?<\/p>\n<p>The truth is, the best car for you, as a real estate agent, is one that matches your community and also targets your niche market.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>\n<a href=\"\/products\/professional-for-agents\/\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-44201\" src=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Blog-CTA-arrows-2.png\" alt=\"Learn more about Market Leader Professional\"><\/a><strong><em>NEED MARKETING HELP?

If she specialized in first-time buyers or condos, however, that car may be viewed as a bit ostentatious.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-31751\" title=\"Real estate agent in his car\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/real-estate-agent-car-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"What type of car should real estate agents drive? Certain agents should drive luxury cars while others should drive more modest ones.\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/>Although New York agents with Modern Agent also deal with luxury property, they drive clients around the city in \u201cDaphne,\u201d the company\u2019s Fiat 500 C convertible ($19,000 when new). Mukul Lalchandani says they settled on the Fiat because it\u2019s small and easy to park \u2013 hello, this IS New York, after all.<\/p>\n<p>Then, there\u2019s Shawn Monshaugen, &#8220;Austin\u2019s first zero-emissions Realtor\u00ae,&#8221; introduced to us by Paul Hagey at Inman. He took a vow to go completely <a href=\"https:\/\/www.inman.com\/2013\/02\/04\/austin-agent-building-a-brand-around-bicycles\/\">carless<\/a> for one year and now offers clients a \u201cbike-level view of real estate,\u201d according to Hagey. This tactic wouldn\u2019t fly in New York or Florida, but it\u2019s amazingly compatible with the young homebuyers in Austin, Texas.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, consider Edina Realty super-agent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.krislindahl.com\/\">Kris Lindahl<\/a>, who swears by his Jeep Overland and claims that tons of agents in town drive SUVs. Ever spend time in the winter in Minnesota? Being able to navigate snowy neighborhood streets is a must.<\/p>\n<p>It seems as if \u201cappropriate\u201d is the word when it comes to choosing a car. Agents in Michigan wouldn\u2019t be caught dead driving an import, while those in Miami, Beverly Hills and Midtown Manhattan, who deal with international clients, should probably be driving something similar in comfort and style to what their Dubai clients drive at home.<\/p>\n<p>Most of the online chatter among agents includes the following musts for real estate agent\u2019s cars:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It must be late model and dent-free with shiny paint.<\/li>\n<li>It must be clean, inside and out.<\/li>\n<li>It must seat at least two other adults.<\/li>\n<li>It must be reliable, safe and insured.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>That fine line mentioned earlier is the one between curb appeal and staging. The former is real \u2013 it remains with the home even after it\u2019s sold.<\/p>\n<p>The latter is, well, phony. Sure, it\u2019s enticing, it\u2019s distracting, but it isn\u2019t real.<\/p>\n<p>Some agents believe perception, not reality, is everything in the real estate business. Yet, in the next breath, they\u2019ll swear that an agent\u2019s highest duty is one of honesty and integrity. Is the $36,000-a-year agent who drives a luxury car in order to create a perception that he\u2019s more successful than he is being honest?<\/p>\n<p>Do your wardrobe and your car offer curb appeal or staging?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Let us know what you think.<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When I was a real estate agent I stowed a pair of muck boots in the trunk of my car.
