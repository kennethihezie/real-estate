The Keller Williams agent has visited, by last count, 41 countries and has lived in several of them.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy grandfather was from Scotland and migrated to Colombia in the 1920s, and married my grandmother who was Colombian,\u201d he explains. \u201cMy other grandfather was from Germany, also migrated to Colombia in the 1920s, and also married a Colombian. I guess I have the spirit of a gypsy,\u201d he said, laughing.<\/p>\n<p>Although Donald was born in Colombia, he has lived in Sidney, Vancouver and the U.S., where he\u2019s been for 10 years now.<\/p>\n<p>Donald\u2019s first trip to the U.S. occurred when he received a Fulbright scholarship to attend the University of California, Berkeley. He graduated with a master&#8217;s degree in business administration. \u201cIt was great,\u201d he says, \u201cit changed my life.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>After graduating from college, Donald worked for Safeway Stores and Kaiser Permanente in strategic planning for a time. It was when he and his wife moved to Australia that he got bit by the real estate bug, while working with commercial investors. The \u201cinfection\u201d simmered inside, however, because the next move he made was back home to Colombia.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI was a trade commissioner for the government of Colombia for about five years. Then we went to Vancouver, and I was the director for an international management diploma program for a university there.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Finally, the couple moved to South Carolina where, for the first time in his adult life, he had trouble finding a job that fit his talents. The solution? \u201cI decided to go into my own business,\u201d he recalls.<\/p>\n<p>One year into his new real estate business, the market tanked. Ever the entrepreneur, he refused to quit. \u201cI decided to focus on a niche market, which was Hispanics,\u201d Donald recalls. \u201cThat allowed me to survive the next five years.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Today, he is finally dusting off his original business plan, which is to develop a market in the Mount Pleasant area. \u201cThere\u2019s a higher price point there than in the Charleston area,\u201d Donald explains. \u201cMy average price point for the first five years was about $175,000, and I think last year our average was about $250,000, so it\u2019s getting better.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At the nine-year mark in his real estate career, Donald\u2019s biggest challenge is growth. \u201cI\u2019ve grown my sales the past three years from 3.5 to 5.8 to 7.5 million, and my next objective is 11 million, so it\u2019s a growth challenge,\u201d he explains. To meet that challenge he\u2019s hired a colleague to help him with the multifaceted parts of the business.<\/p>\n<h2>Marketing Plans<\/h2>\n<p>Despite claiming that he hasn\u2019t been diligent in past-client retention, 80 percent of Donald\u2019s business comes from his sphere and referrals from past clients. The rest are Internet leads.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had a big focus on online lead generation in the last couple of years,\u201d he said. \u201cOnline you have to be everywhere; there isn\u2019t one source of leads. The fact is, you don\u2019t know where they\u2019re going to find you,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo we do everything. We have four websites, five blogs; we have videos, four Facebook pages and two Pinterest pages. You name it &#8211; whatever generates leads online, we do it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He also plans on kicking his client retention program into high gear in 2014. \u201cWe have our plan all mapped out and budgeted for,\u201d said Donald. \u201cThis year we\u2019ll be doing what they call a \u201833 touch program,\u2019 meaning we\u2019ll try to touch everyone in our database 33 times a year. That includes everything from email newsletters to postcards, client events, phone conversations and in-person meetings,\u201d he concluded.<\/p>\n<p>Donald claims that if it weren\u2019t for Market Leader\u2019s tools doing the heavy lifting, he couldn\u2019t handle such an intense marketing campaign. \u201cOne of the things that I like about Market Leader is the ability to set people on alerts &#8211; pretty much on automatic &#8211; so that people can set it up themselves and get listings in their email every day,\u201d Donald explains. \u201cIt\u2019s branded; it comes from me. I\u2019m in front of them every day without me having to do much. When they\u2019re ready, they put up their hand.<\/p>\n<p>Market Leader\u2019s tools, he explains, give him the ability to configure even the most detailed marketing campaigns. He utilizes the templates the most, and he appreciates that he can customize them.<\/p>\n<h2>The Best Part of Real Estate<\/h2>\n<p>So, what does a die-hard entrepreneur with an MBA enjoy most about his career in real estate?<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat I enjoy about real estate is that there\u2019s no limit to what you can do or not do, except by law,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cIn terms of business, you can be creative and set up your business the way you want and manage it the way you want,\u201d Donald continues.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNo one\u2019s telling you how to do it. I\u2019m very entrepreneurial in spirit as you can see. I enjoy being creative, creating things and setting up businesses. That\u2019s the part that I like a lot.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Downtime<\/h2>\n<p>Donald is an avid tennis player, so when he\u2019s not working, he hits the courts. He also gives back to the community by mentoring area students. \u201cI belong to the Citadel School of Business mentorship program,\u201d he begins. \u201cI do some mentorship also for some students at the College of Charleston.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A self-described \u201cproduct of international migration,\u201d Alan Donald inherited the itch to travel.
