AJ Ackerman, with CENTURY 21 Sunbelt Realty, has that, but he also has an inherent desire to serve people.<\/p>\n<p>As the son of an entrepreneur dad and a mom who spent most of her adult life working for the Hilton Hotels Corporation, \u201cCustomer service was a big part of who I was growing up,\u201d he told us.<\/p>\n<p>The lifestyle of corporate America drove him away, however. \u201cMy mom would work 70, 80 hours a week,\u201d he said, \u201cso I learned pretty quickly it wasn\u2019t what I wanted.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Good Old Days<\/h2>\n<p>Ackerman was born in Las Vegas, but because of his mother\u2019s career with Hilton, the family moved around a bit. \u201cI\u2019ve lived in Vegas, Florida, Chicago and Atlanta,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Although his parents had him in modeling as a child, and he was with the Mickey Mouse Club in Orlando, his dream as a child was to follow in his grandfather\u2019s footsteps and become an Air Force pilot. \u201cThat went about as far as a poster on a wall,\u201d he said, laughing.<\/p>\n<p>It was his father\u2019s footsteps he eventually stepped into. \u201cMy dad was an entrepreneur; he was in sales his whole life,\u201d Ackerman explained.<\/p>\n<h2>Real Estate Happens<\/h2>\n<p>\u201cIn 2008 I went through a really bad breakup. I had some partners and we owned a custom deck-building company, and it wasn\u2019t working out \u2026 the economy was kind of taking a hit,\u201d Ackerman began. \u201cI lost everything I owned. Somebody owed me money for four months\u2019 worth of work \u2013 I was never paid. It was just crazy, there was a lot going on,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Shortly after his 30<sup>th<\/sup> birthday, Ackerman had a sit-down with himself \u2013 one of those man-in-the-mirror moments.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI had just turned thirty and I felt like I should be much farther along in my life,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI looked in the mirror and said, \u2018Alright, everything is up to you, and the reason you are where you are is because of you.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He decided to pay a visit to his best friend of 20 years who had moved back to Cape Coral, Fla., where the two had attended high school. He decided to stay.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy friend\u2019s father had been in real estate for about 30 years,\u201d said Ackerman. \u201cFor some reason I couldn\u2019t find a job &#8211; it was crazy. So I said, \u201cRandy, I\u2019m at my best friend\u2019s house and sleeping on his couch, I\u2019ve got no car, I\u2019ve got no place to live. I\u2019ve got a brain and I\u2019m ready to use it if there\u2019s anything I can do to help,\u201d he recalled.<\/p>\n<p>Randy put Ackerman to work making cold calls. He lasted two weeks before discovering that he could and should be making those calls for himself. So, with Randy\u2019s assistance, he studied for the real estate exam. A little over three weeks later he had his license and started making calls on his own behalf.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy first six months in the business I did a million dollars in sales,\u201d Ackerman said. \u201cThat was in 2009. I\u2019ll hit four and a half years in the business at the end of this year, and I\u2019ll do about seven and a half or eight million in sales. I\u2019ve been working hard,\u201d he explained, laughing.<\/p>\n<h2>Challenges<\/h2>\n<p>Asked about the challenges he faces at this point in his career, Ackerman said, \u201cMy biggest challenge right now is delegating business and figuring out how to take it to the next level as far as becoming a broker and owning my own brokerage, building a team and leadership.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Ackerman is working on next year\u2019s business plan, and we asked for a peek into it.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy three main goals for next year are to be among the top 100 agents in my area, so continuing to grow my business is important,\u201d he began. \u201cThe second is to become financially stable as far as finally not having any debt and having reserves put away. The third is I want to continue to grow in all the other areas of my life,\u201d Ackerman concluded.<\/p>\n<h2>Keeping the Funnel Full<\/h2>\n<p>Ackerman is still an avid cold caller. We asked him if he has any advice for agents who suffer from call reluctance.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou gotta figure out why you\u2019re doing what you\u2019re doing,\u201d he began. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a reason, you\u2019re not going to do it. When I first started in the business I was in survival mode; I had no other options but to call people at the time,\u201d Ackerman continued.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy reason is different now. Right now I\u2019m worth about $150 an hour. When I get on the phone I don\u2019t think about the calls that I\u2019m making, I\u2019m thinking about how much money I\u2019ll make if I make the calls. I don\u2019t look at it as cold calling. I look at it as building a life to be able to have happiness and be able to make the choices I want.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Ackerman also divulged that he is most successful when calling around new listings and homes he\u2019s sold.<\/p>\n<h2>The Tools of His Trade<\/h2>\n<p>Ackerman figures that about 40 percent of last year\u2019s business came from past clients and referrals, and he credits his CRM for that.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOne of the most important things for me when I started building my business was a contact management system; it\u2019s a huge key to long-term success,\u201d he said. \u201cI do email campaigns. I also try to call everyone at least three times a year, minimum,\u201d Ackerman continued.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA contact management system like the one I have from Market Leader allows me to do a lot of things. I do email campaigns; I leave reminders to give them a call every three or four months.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In fact, his CRM is the one tool he considers most critical to his real estate business. \u201cWithout being able to keep track of everything, I would never be able to grow as fast as I\u2019m growing.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>The Best Part of Real Estate<\/h2>\n<p>Ackerman claims that his real estate business fulfills everything he wanted in a career. We asked him about the best part of being in the business.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEverything,\u201d he said, chuckling. \u201cI love what I do. I love the freedom. I love that I have no limits to what I can make &#8211; it\u2019s all up to me. I love that I can help people. When people buy or sell homes I\u2019m ultimately helping them accomplish some type of goal. Everything I\u2019ve ever wanted, I can get in real estate.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Being a customer service whiz comes naturally when one has years of experience in both the hospitality and food service industries.
