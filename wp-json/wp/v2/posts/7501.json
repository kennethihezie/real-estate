Your newsletter should support your overall marketing strategy. If it doesn\u2019t, you could be wasting time, money, and energy.<\/p>\n<p>That might seem like a daunting task at first. But don\u2019t worry. With these five fail-safe marketing tips and five ideas for newsletter content, you\u2019ll have all you need to create effective, compelling, and engaging newsletters.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">1. Identify Your Target Audience<\/h2>\n<p>This is the most important step. And yet it\u2019s the step that gets overlooked most often.<\/p>\n<p>You can\u2019t nail the bullseye if you don\u2019t know where the target is. So before you do anything, think through <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/blog\/creating-a-target-market-for-your-real-estate-business\/\">the target market for your newsletters<\/a>. Then establish goals. What do you want your newsletters to accomplish as they relate to your overall marketing strategy?<\/p>\n<p>It might be tempting to think you\u2019re marketing to \u201ceveryone.\u201d But real estate marketing strategies like that tend to be unfruitful. It\u2019s been said many times, but it bears repeating: if you try to be all things to all people, you run the risk of not being anything to anyone.<\/p>\n<p>Who are you trying to stay in contact with? Who are you trying to sell homes to? Are they retirees? First-time homebuyers? People purchasing investment properties? The more specific you can get, the better.<\/p>\n<p>Depending on where you are on your journey as a real estate agent, this step might take some time. But developing a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/blog\/the-7-essentials-of-real-estate-marketing-plans\/\">solid real estate marketing strategy<\/a> is always worth it.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">2. Tailor Your Newsletter to Your Target Audience\u2019s Needs<\/h2>\n<p>Don\u2019t make the mistake of talking about yourself all the time. \u201cI just sold this amazing house.\u201d \u201cHere\u2019s why I\u2019m the number one agent in the city.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Of course, there\u2019s nothing wrong with a little self-promotion here and there. But if it ever comes close to appearing that you are all you care about, you\u2019ve gone too far.<\/p>\n<p>Your readers probably already know how great you are. That may be why they subscribed to your newsletter to begin with! Ultimately, what they\u2019re after is the benefit. They want to know what\u2019s in it for them.<\/p>\n<p>So gear all of your content (even your own promotional plugs) toward your reader and how they can benefit. Make it a habit to ask yourself these two questions as you craft your newsletter: \u201cSo what? Who cares?\u201d Each section of every newsletter you send should provide answers to those questions.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s get even more specific. Be sure to tailor your content according to the type of lead with whom you\u2019re communicating. There&#8217;s no better way to get people to tune you out than to send them content that doesn&#8217;t relate to their needs. Have you taken steps to ensure your seller leads are only receiving content relevant for people considering selling their homes? What about for buyers?<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">3. Choose the Format<\/h2>\n<p>Decide if you want a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/blog\/make-print-marketing-part-of-your-strategy\/\">print<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/blog\/the-real-estate-guide-to-email-marketing-and-automation\/\">email<\/a> newsletter. (Or both!)<\/p>\n<p>While print newsletters might cost more than emailing, they continue to perform well year after year. With <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/solutions\/marketing-automation\/\">the right marketing tool<\/a>, they\u2019re easier to create and print than you might think. Everything from designing to printing to shipping your print newsletters can be taken care of in a single system like Market Leader Professional.<\/p>\n<p>Print newsletters can be just as effective as email newsletters (if not more so). Why? One of the main reasons is that the reach of direct mail tends to be more focused. It has less to compete with than email.<\/p>\n<p>For example, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usps.com\/business\/promotions\/direct-mail-brochure.pdf\">one report<\/a> indicated that the average person receives over 150 emails per day, whereas the average household receives only about two pieces of mail per day. Plus, print newsletters have staying power: they can easily be passed on, left in waiting rooms, or handed out in person. The con? Direct mail is less of a trackable medium than email, limiting your ability to monitor and track progress.<\/p>\n<p>Email newsletters one the other hand are less expensive and even easier to create. And emails make it much easier for you to collect all of the data you want, monitor success, and iterate your strategy. But if you\u2019re not careful, they can look like spam or get lost in the sea of other emails your prospects get on any given day.<\/p>\n<p>Can\u2019t decide? Go back to your overall marketing strategy. If your target audience consists of retirees, for example, a printed newsletter might best. If you\u2019re aiming for relatively young first-time buyers, maybe it\u2019s best to go the email route.<\/p>\n<p>And remember, there isn\u2019t necessarily a right or wrong answer. It\u2019s about what works best for your particular audience.<\/p>\n<p>You may even choose to do both. Reaching out to people with two mediums increases the likelihood that you connect with them. If you call someone every day at 1 p.m. and they don\u2019t pick up, you should try calling at a different time. The same concept applies to newsletters: If you can\u2019t connect with email, print might work.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">4. Pack Your Newsletter With Engaging Content<\/h2>\n<p>Whether you go with print or email, it\u2019s always important to stand out. Your number one newsletter content priority is to keep your reader engaged. Here are some general guidelines worth following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pay special attention to the design elements and make it look appealing.<br \/>\nMake it interesting and easy to read.<\/li>\n<li>Be concise.<\/li>\n<li>Provide relevant information about buying and selling and other related topics.<\/li>\n<li>Provide research and insight with useful, compelling, and actionable data.<\/li>\n<li>Include calls to action.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In other words, make it valuable.<\/p>\n<p>Personalizing your newsletter will make it stand out from the crowd. So write about topics that are interesting to you or that your target market will find informative. You are trying to connect with your audience, and there\u2019s nothing that will lose that connection faster than a boring newsletter.<\/p>\n<p>Need some inspiration on content themes for your real estate newsletters? Here are five ideas to jumpstart your imagination.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">Idea #1: Inform<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Customize your newsletter for each prospect. If you know where your prospect is searching, talk about interesting things happening in that area: new shopping centers opening up, schools that performed highly on state exams, local bars and restaurants with great reviews, etc. If you have too many prospects to manage something like this, customize your content according to your top five prospects\u2019 personalities and interests.<\/li>\n<li>Keep your prospects up to date with trends in interest rates, home values, and neighborhood stats.<\/li>\n<li>Most consumers will be interested in listings. Take a few listings that are extremely interesting (customized to the prospect) and post them on your newsletter with a link back to your website. This keeps them engaged with you and off unrelated websites where they&#8217;ll run into other agents vying for their attention.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">Idea #2: Offer Discounts to Local Businesses<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>This is a great way to add tangible value to your newsletter. But more than that, it shows that you have a variety of local connections, which can go a long way to boost your credibility as a real estate agent.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">Idea #3: Make It Warm &amp; Relational<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Express your personality (while always keeping it professional, of course).<\/li>\n<li>Share pictures and personal updates.<\/li>\n<li>Sure this is a nice idea. But it\u2019s more than that. Adding a small relational component to your newsletter shows that you\u2019re not just a sales shark hunting for your next closing.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">Idea #4: Provide Helpful Advice<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Position yourself as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/blog\/3-tactics-to-position-yourself-as-the-neighborhood-expert\/\">the local expert<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Do the work of analysis for them. Numbers, charts, and infographics are great, but always be sure to help your readers understand the data. Offer suggestions and draw conclusions.<\/li>\n<li>Want to take your marketing strategy to the next level? Write a blog where you can share your expert opinion on trending topics in real estate and link your newsletter to it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">Idea #5: Make It Fun<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Include games, puzzles, amusing articles, contests, recipes, or funny cartoons and videos.<\/li>\n<li>But remember: adding a touch of entertainment to an otherwise boring newsletter isn\u2019t \u201cjust for fun.\u201d If it\u2019s done well, it can be extremely useful in helping you establish a connection with your leads.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>First we considered the importance of developing a real estate marketing strategy, establishing your target audience, and tailoring your newsletter to fit your readers\u2019 needs.
