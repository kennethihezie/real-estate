We live in a digital era. According to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nar.realtor\/sites\/default\/files\/reports\/2014\/2014-profile-of-home-buyers-and-sellers-highlights.pdf\">2014 NAR Profile of Homebuyers and Sellers:<\/a><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>92 percent of homebuyers use the Internet when looking for information<\/li>\n<li>76 percent of buyers view homes or drive by homes for sale that they first find online<\/li>\n<li>43 percent of buyers found their home on the Internet<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This business is tough enough, but if your website is making you look like you\u2019re stuck in the 90s, while the rest of the real estate industry is moving on without you, you\u2019re ceding a massive marketplace to competitors.<\/p>\n<p>Here are eight vital signs your website presence needs a massive overhaul to catch up with the 21<sup>st<\/sup> century.<\/p>\n<h2>Have a Flash Intro on Your Website<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-45721\" title=\"bad real estate website\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/bad-real-estate-website-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"Signs Your Website Is Stuck in the Dark Ages\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" \/>This is especially true if there\u2019s text in the Flash imagery. Search engines can\u2019t read text in a Flash animation. To the internet robots, they just look like image files. It\u2019s like handing a photocopy of a braille book to a blind man and asking him to read it. It just doesn\u2019t work. If you have text in a Flash piece, retype it into regular text. Then dump the Flash.<\/p>\n<h2>Cheesy Glam Photos<\/h2>\n<p>You\u2019ve seen them. Photos of agents with 80s feathered hair that\u2019s been out of style since Frankie went to Hollywood, complete with a pantyhose effect over the lens. Leave the glam shots for your high school yearbook, and go get a proper portrait done.<\/p>\n<h2>Crummy E-mail Addresses<\/h2>\n<p>Real estate agents are professionals. People entrust hundreds of thousands, even millions of dollars, to their care. If you have an email address like fairyangel1000@aol.com or harleydude51@yahoo.com, that\u2019s one more item that undermines the trust that people have in you. Invest in a real email address and domain.<\/p>\n<h2>No Lead Capture Functionality<\/h2>\n<p>Not having this feature alone can kill your practice as a real estate agent. Consumers are now more used to entering basic information into a form, to give you permission to contact them. If a customer wants to see a house, they\u2019ll be willing to let a professional agent contact them about it. Even if it doesn\u2019t lead to an immediate sale, lead capture functionality is a key way of adding contacts to your drip marketing program. Plus, your lead capture system is a powerful defense against any accusation that you violated Do Not Call rules.<\/p>\n<h2>Not Mobile Friendly<\/h2>\n<p>Sure, you\u2019ve had your site up for years. But have you actually looked at it on an iPhone? An Android phone or tablet? You need to do that regularly. Just because a site works on your desktop doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not loading up as gibberish on a mobile device.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-45751\" title=\"consumer using smartphone\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/consumer-using-smartphone-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"Real estate website mistake: not being mobile-friendly\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" \/>When a potential homebuyer drives by one of your listings, sees your sign in front of the house and wants to look up the online listing, do you think they\u2019re going to write the information down in a notebook and drive home to a big screen desktop? No! They\u2019re going to look you up, on the spot, on their smartphone. If your site is legible and functional, and they\u2019re interested, they\u2019ll call you or drop their contact info in your lead capture system.<\/p>\n<p>According to research by iAquire, 40 percent of users will give up if your site is not mobile friendly. You will never see or hear from them. Furthermore, 70 percent of searches on mobile sites lead to actions on websites within one hour.<\/p>\n<h2>Bad Stock Photography<\/h2>\n<p>Increasingly, consumers are accustomed to seeing homes marketed with beautiful imagery. Think of high-end magazine photography, like Real Simple and Architectural Digest<em>.<\/em> Your website\u2019s top images should convey an elegant and refined look. Most cheap or free stock photo sites are nowhere near the industry standard. For the purposes of branding you and your business, invest in some proper images.<\/p>\n<h2>Bad Agent Photography<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re not a camera fiend, get a professional photographer to take photographs for you. Actually, you should probably do this anyway. You\u2019re not a professional photographer \u2013 even if it\u2019s a passion in your private life. You\u2019re a real estate agent.<\/p>\n<p>Every minute you spend setting up the perfect shot and tweaking the image on Photoshop is a minute better spent on the phone, talking to contacts and setting up listings, showings and closings. And counting your commission checks. Photography is a non-core activity for you. Delegate it as soon as you can.

If you spent time writing a great blog post or informative article, you\u2019ve probably branded it with your name and contact information. If it\u2019s useful, people will want to share it with friends. And if it makes you look like an expert, you want this information shared as much as possible. It builds your credibility and helps you grow your business. Make sure your social sharing tools are easy to find.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We\u2019ve all seen them: Websites that are supposed to sell, but wind up making their owners look dumb, inept or out of touch.
