His holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, owns a big chunk of Coca Cola \u2013 one of the greatest brands in history. \u201cI could take a billion dollars, and I still couldn\u2019t make a dent in Coca Cola\u2019s market share,\u201d he told a group business students at the University of Florida.<\/p>\n<p>Buffett has long been attracted to strong brands, and in recent years has owned stakes in Visa, Verizon, Pampers, and Gillette (via parent company Proctor &amp; Gamble).<\/p>\n<p>Brands are valuable things: Investors have paid billions just for the use of a name. Corporate accountants list the value of a brand on company balance sheets (look in any major brand\u2019s parent company\u2019s annual report under the heading \u201cgoodwill.\u201d)<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wppwrap.com\/brandztop100global2017\/mobile\/#p=17\">A recent study from Kantar Millward Brown<\/a> found that a basket of stocks representing the world\u2019s top 100 brands outperformed the S&amp;P 500 over the ten years ending in April 2017, 129 percent to 81 percent.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Branding in the Real Estate Business<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The real estate business is no different. The big real estate brokerages all carefully build their brands \u2013 and zealously guard them against internal and external threats.<\/p>\n<p>This is serious business. For many companies, its brand is one of its most important assets. A quick look at RE\/MAX\u2019s 2016 annual report shows that <a href=\"http:\/\/s2.q4cdn.com\/001766218\/files\/doc_financials\/annual_reports\/Remax-2016-Annual-Report.pdf\">the company estimated its brand and associated goodwill to be worth <em>$126 million.<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s more than the net present value of all its franchise agreements ($109 million) and representing 29 percent of the total assets of the company.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>What is a Brand?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Your brand, essentially, is what other people think of you and your real estate business. Your brand audience doesn\u2019t just include customers and clients, but also other real estate agents and allied professionals, as well. In a crowded field with lots of competitors, it\u2019s your brand that makes your real estate business unique in the eyes of your community, and sets you apart from your competition.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s much more than a logo or catchphrase, though those are important elements. <strong>Your brand is the set of values and associations that the public associates with you.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t manage your brand, <em>others will define it for you.<\/em> Including competitors.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Basics of Real Estate Agent Brand Management<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Make a plan<strong>. <\/strong>Nobody makes a great building without a <a href=\"https:\/\/success.marketleader.com\/l\/42972\/2017-09-26\/655jdj\">blueprint<\/a>. Similarly, nobody builds a great brand without a <a href=\"https:\/\/success.marketleader.com\/l\/42972\/2017-10-25\/6bp7dn\">marketing plan<\/a>. That means investing in developing a good branding guide as soon as possible.<\/p>\n<p>A logo\u2019s a good start, but it\u2019s only a start. Businesses serious about building a valuable brand invest a significant amount of time and effort into it, and create a brand identity document that helps them stay on message and consistent in everything they do.<\/p>\n<p>RE\/MAX\u2019s own set of branding guidelines, <a href=\"https:\/\/remax-saarlouis.de\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Marken-_und_Grafikstandards.pdf\">available online here,<\/a> is an excellent example of a good branding guide. While many branding documents just deal with how to display the logo, RE\/MAX\u2019s guide starts by establishing a set of values.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Branding Fundamentals<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Real estate agents and agency principals should keep these basic branding principles in mind:<\/p>\n<h5>1. Be consistent.<\/h5>\n<p>Brand every communication with your company name and logo.<\/p>\n<h5>2. Brand\u00a0<em>yourself<\/em>, not just your company.<\/h5>\n<p>As an agent of your business, your personal brand is just as important as your company\u2019s brand. If someone wants to research your services online, odds are they\u2019ll find your personal pages as well. Be mindful of your client\u2019s journey and be sure your personal and business brands are consistent.<\/p>\n<h5>3. Stay on message.<\/h5>\n<p>You can never repeat your brand message too often. Repetition counts.<\/p>\n<h5>4. Invest in a good website.<\/h5>\n<p>In today&#8217;s digital environment, your web presence is often your best and most important brand messenger. 90 percent of home searches begin online according to research from the National Association of Realtors. You want your brand to be in front of these people.<\/p>\n<h5>5. Create your &#8220;Pizza Statement.&#8221;<\/h5>\n<p>Your pizza statement is what marketing consultants call your <em>unique value proposition. <\/em>This should be something that sets you apart in some way, and that competitors would have a hard time matching. Domino\u2019s Pizza had one of the greatest UVP\u2019s of all time: \u201cFresh, hot pizza in 30 minutes or less, guaranteed.\u201d<\/p>\n<h5>6. Define a market to dominate.<\/h5>\n<p>For you, it might be a certain neighborhood or development. Or a certain kind of client. You can\u2019t compete with the giants and fight for your whole state. But you can beat them on your own home turf. You want to dominate your space. But in order to dominate it, you must first <em>define<\/em> it. For example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u201cThe restaurant experts.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>\u201cThe Frisco relocation team\u201d<\/li>\n<li>\u201cYour source for &lt;insert neighborhood&gt; homes\u201d<\/li>\n<li>\u201cThe condo people\u201d<\/li>\n<li>\u201cSpecializing in serving veterans and their families\u201d<\/li>\n<li>\u201cThe experts in North Dallas luxury homes\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Finally, <em>don\u2019t get carried away!<\/em> If you\u2019re just starting out, don\u2019t get so focused on branding that you forget the basics. Spend your time prospecting, meeting with potential sellers and buyers, showing homes and asking for the sale. Too many people in the real estate business spend too much time obsessing over logos and websites. Beware of avoidance behavior. Don\u2019t let branding distract you from the activity that generates sales, or you won\u2019t be in the real estate business long enough to see your brand grow.<\/p>\n<p>Eyes on the prize.<\/p>\n<h4>Looking for more?
