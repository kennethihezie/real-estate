I\u2019m a little jealous that several of my event marketing peeps, like Alex Allison with Dot Loop and Dan Stewart of Happy Grasshopper, are in New York City this week attending one of the most influential real estate industry events of the year, Real Estate Connect New York City, hosted by Inman News. Not only is NYC one of my favorite cities to visit, but Inman Connect stays true to its name. It\u2019s all about bringing the smartest, most talented speakers and technology gurus within the real estate industry together to connect and inspire. (If you want to learn the true value of this, read my blog post on why <a href=\"\/blog\/why-real-estate-conferences-conventions-are-important-for-business\/\">real estate industry events<\/a> are important for business.)<\/p>\n<p>Attendees will get to hang out with Katie Lance and Chris Smith from Inman News, two of my favorite peeps within the industry.
