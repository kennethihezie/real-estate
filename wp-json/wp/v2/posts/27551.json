We certainly are, and we\u2019d love to share what we\u2019ve learned about him and his growing real estate practice with Keller Williams.<\/p>\n<p>Hogue is a native Kentuckian, and although he attended the University of Kentucky with an eye toward engineering, he ended up in the U.S. Marine Corps, where he remained for six years.<\/p>\n<h2>The Path to Real Estate<\/h2>\n<p>Hogue kicked around a bit after his discharge from the Marines and ended up in culinary school in Chicago and New York, where he studied to be a pastry chef and proceeded to \u201cgain way too much weight,\u201d he said, laughing.<\/p>\n<p>In 1990 he met Holly, his current wife, and they started an advertising firm. &#8220;We did advertising set-up for companies and worked with corporations on their ad campaigns and full color work,\u201d he said. Most of the companies, such as McDonnell Douglas and Boeing, weren\u2019t local, so the Hogues became one of the first ad companies to utilize file transfer protocol or email to submit proofs.<\/p>\n<p>This experience put them on the leading edge of the World Wide Web, and they took advantage of the opportunity. \u201cWe developed websites for everyone from the federal government to a baseball team to banks and banking operations &#8211; we did back-ends for them,\u201d Hogue explained. They also provided hosting. \u201cThen, 2000 hit and we didn\u2019t know it, but we were already out of business,\u201d he continued.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen the technology bubble burst, people that we had been charging a large amount of money for hosting could all of a sudden get that same hosting for almost nothing,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWe lasted until about 2007 when I finally looked at my wife and said, \u2018Hey, I haven\u2019t been getting a paycheck for a while &#8211; I\u2019m going to go do something else.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>So in December of 2008, with a brand new real estate license, Hogue joined Keller Williams Louisville East, and he\u2019s been with them ever since.<\/p>\n<h2>It\u2019s About Time<\/h2>\n<p>Every business has its challenges. They never go away, but evolve over time. We asked Hogue what he\u2019s facing at the six-year mark in his career.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cRight now my biggest challenge is time management, more than anything else. I want it done now and I want it done my way,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cTime is my nemesis.\u201d He is finally at that point many agents get to when they decide they need help, and 2014 is the year he plans on putting together a team.<\/p>\n<h2>Marketing the Hogue Way<\/h2>\n<p>Having practically cut his teeth on the Internet before the rest of us knew what it was, Hogue depends heavily on online marketing. \u201cI have 27 websites and various blogs, along with my eEdge \u2013 which is the biggest one I market,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe get roughly 9,000 people a month at that website.\u201d He pushes the site through social media, Craigslist, blogs, and he even has the site\u2019s URL on his car.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe were averaging 200 to 300 signups a month at the site during its peak. Then Craigslist changed and we lost thousands of visitors every month,\u201d he said. Last year, 38 percent of his business came from Craigslist.<\/p>\n<h2>When He\u2019s Not Working<\/h2>\n<p>Hogue and his wife do a lot of charity work with the local zoo and 15Thousand Farmers, a group that teaches folks how to become sustainable backyard farmers and then provides them with everything they need to get started. \u201cWe donate rain barrels and other items every year.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He also has a horse-crazy, 9-year-old granddaughter who gets a lot of his attention when he\u2019s not working.<\/p>\n<h2>Hogue and Market Leader<\/h2>\n<p>We\u2019re always interested in how our clients became involved with Market Leader and how our products have impacted their businesses. Hogue was using Top Producer when he first got into the business. \u201cIt was the tool of choice,\u201d he claimed.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt was a little clunky,\u201d he continued, \u201cso when Market Leader was first produced, I walked up to the booth at Family Reunion to see what they had. I took one look and told the guy I wanted to be an ambassador and wanted to go head over heels based just on what I saw,\u201d Hogue said. \u201cI dropped Top Producer within a week of when I took on eEdge.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He\u2019s glad he did, too. His first year in the business he did a respectable 15 transactions. Once he started using Market Leader products, he did 37 transactions. \u201cConsidering the average agent in Louisville does about six transactions a year, to me, 37 is good,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>We asked Hogue about his most rewarding moments during a typical workweek. He didn\u2019t hesitate before answering: \u201cSmiling faces across the table when I hand them their keys.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If it\u2019s true that people with a lot of interests are interesting people, then you\u2019ll be fascinated by Rick Hogue, an agent in Louisville, Ky.
