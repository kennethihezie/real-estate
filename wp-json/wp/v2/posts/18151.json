So, when an agent tells you that her favorite aspect of her career is \u201cthe travel,\u201d it might just make you scratch your head.<\/p>\n<p>Laurie Weston Davis, of Keller Williams Realty in Pinehurst, N.C. isn\u2019t just any real estate agent. First, she has reached that point in her career where instead of setting her boots on the ground every morning, listing and selling local homes, she dons her managerial cap and oversees her members of a 30-person team.<\/p>\n<p>Then, she\u2019s a <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/thegeekygirls\">Geeky Girl<\/a>, \u201chelping others discover their inner geek,\u201d with the other half of the G.G. team, Lisa Ludlow Archer.<\/p>\n<h2>But, Wait \u2026<\/h2>\n<p>We\u2019re getting a bit ahead of ourselves. Davis started life as an Air Force brat, \u201cmoving around a bit,\u201d she says, laughing. By the time she turned 10, Dad retired from the military and moved the family to Miami, from whence the family originally hailed. After seven years in the home state, however, they packed up and moved again to North Carolina, where Davis finished high school.<\/p>\n<p>Growing up, Davis dreamed of being a mom. That was only natural for a little girl being raised by a stay-at-home mom who never had a job outside of the home. \u201cThat was what I knew when I was growing up,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI wanted to have kids, and a family, and all that good stuff.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Davis did just that. She married a Navy man right out of college and found herself in that familiar milieu of moving around the country again. The couple lived in California for about 10 years, both in San Diego and in the Bay Area. \u201cI had my first son while we were in California, and I pretty much stayed home with him,\u201d Davis says.<\/p>\n<p>Davis has two sons; the eldest is now 26 and a lawyer. The younger son, aged 23, graduated from college one year ago and has plans to attend graduate school. \u201cThey\u2019ve been very good children,\u201d Davis says. \u201cThey make me happy.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>From Soccer Mom to Selling Homes<\/h2>\n<p>Davis\u2019 husband is a cardiologist in Pinehurst, but he did his internship in the Navy. When he got out of the military, about 15 years ago, they decided that it would be the ideal place for hubby to start a practice since they both had family in North Carolina. It turns out it was also a great place for Laurie to do the same.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy oldest was going off to college &#8211; to Tulane in New Orleans for his undergraduate work &#8211; and my youngest was a junior in high school. He had his driver\u2019s license, so he didn\u2019t need me toting him around anymore,\u201d she recalls.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSuddenly I had a lot of free time and I thought, \u2018What am I going to do with myself?\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>She echoed the sentiment to a friend who happened to suggest she join him in his real estate practice at a small, boutique firm. It just so happened that the friend had a number of developers on his client roster, so Davis began her career sitting at new developments.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt was a good way to get started because I had people coming to me every day, and I got experience working with buyers and showing property,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n<h2>Motherhood Beckons<\/h2>\n<p>Something snaps in many women when the youngest child enters the last year of high school. It\u2019s a definite signal that the work of active motherhood is almost over. It\u2019s a time filled with \u201cwhat ifs\u201d and hopes that you did your job well.<\/p>\n<p>Davis decided that she wanted one more shot at full-time motherhood. \u201cI decided that I really wanted to be more involved. I mean, once he was gone, he was going to be gone, so I took a sabbatical,\u201d she recalls. Davis spent that year following her son\u2019s sporting events \u2013 in essence, being the \u201csoccer mom\u201d all over again. It\u2019s a decision she will never regret.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOnce he went off to college I was ready to get back into it,\u201d Davis says. This time, she decided she would look for a different broker. \u201cAt that time there was a company starting up and the agents and brokers were the type of people I wanted to be in business with,\u201d she says. \u201cI ended up joining that company and realized afterward that they were actually preparing to become a Keller Williams office. I\u2019ve been with them ever since.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Another decision Davis doesn\u2019t regret. In fact, she advises all rookie agents to \u201cchoose wisely.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe people you surround yourself with in the beginning is critical,\u201d she cautions. \u201cHaving people that are going to support you &#8211; and help you grow, and be positive, and be your cheerleader &#8211; is just huge. If you aren\u2019t careful, you can end up with folks that are naysayers, and that will just drag you down,\u201d Davis continues. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough business. You get a lot of rejection. You kind of need that positive strength behind you.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Systems, Tools and Other Geeky Stuff<\/h2>\n<p>Davis also recommends that new agents choose the right tools and systems from the beginning. \u201cHaving the website, the CRM and all of the things you\u2019ll need in place from the start is important,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n<p>She was introduced to Market Leader products when she joined Keller Williams. \u201cThe Pinehurst team has Professional,\u201d she says, \u201cand in Charlotte we use the Business Suite.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>She used Top Producer before joining Keller Williams. \u201cI really didn\u2019t use it because it wasn\u2019t user friendly as far as I was concerned,\u201d she says. \u201cOnce I got on board with Market Leader it was very different. The contact management part of it is critical, and it all kind of fits together with the whole Keller Williams philosophy. It\u2019s pretty simple for us to use.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Davis upgraded to Professional because \u201cit made sense,\u201d she claims. \u201cWe use it to do a lot of our lead gen, and also the Craigslist tools are awesome,\u201d Davis explains. \u201cWe noticed that there was a fairly significant increase in the response we got from Craigslist since we started using the tools,\u201d she continues. \u201cFor some reason the ads just seemed to be \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 more appealing, or more trustworthy; they just seem to work better.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>The Team<\/h2>\n<p>Davis has a partner, not only in business, but in the Geeky Girls as well. Her name is Lisa Ludlow Archer, and she runs the Raleigh team while Davis runs the Pinehurst team. They\u2019ve been business partners for one year now.<\/p>\n<p>Their Geeky Girl partnership, on the other hand, goes back three years. \u201cWe\u2019re both very active in social media and do a lot of social and Internet lead generation,\u201d she explains. \u201cThe Geeky Girls speak and teach all over the country, which is one way we get referral business,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n<p>Archer explained to me last year that the Geeky Girls aim to raise \u201cthe bar in the industry. There are so many agents stuck in their tracks that have no idea what to do next,\u201d she said. \u201cWe consider ourselves ambassadors, or, as some people call us, \u2018badassadors,\u2019 for IMSD \u2026 Hear It Direct,\u201d and others.<\/p>\n<p>This, by the way, is how Davis\u2019 current travel jones is being fed. \u201cI do travel a lot and meet a lot of people. It\u2019s actually broadened my world significantly,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI live in a pretty small little village here. I travel to San Francisco, and I just got back from Chicago. I know people everywhere now. I have good friends all over the country, and even though I don\u2019t see them all the time, I still consider them very close friends.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>All real estate is local.
