Arguments for and Against"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Welcome to the long-standing discussion about whether agents should give real estate closing gifts to their clients. Of course, we won\u2019t settle the matter here. But reaching a universal conclusion that works for every agent everywhere for all time isn\u2019t really the point anyway.<\/p>\n<p>The question behind the question is (or at least should be): What\u2019s the best way an agent can build a strong relationship with their clients after a closing, and does gift-giving have anything to do with that?<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, only you can decide what\u2019s best for your business and your clients.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s start with the objections.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">The 2 Main Arguments Against Giving Real Estate Closing Gifts<\/h2>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">What\u2019s the Point?<\/h3>\n<p>In other words, a real estate closing gift serves no purpose. Or so the argument goes.Not only will you discover the only good reason to give real estate closing gifts, you\u2019ll also learn how to do it. Plus, you\u2019ll get 8 closing gift ideas!<\/p>\n<p>Why should an agent give their clients a gift after closing? Is it to keep up with expectations? To give just because every other agent gives? To keep you at the top of your clients\u2019 minds?<\/p>\n<p>Those are valid reasons to give. But this first objection calls all of those reasons into question and gets us wondering if it \u201cworks,\u201d if gift-giving is really worth it. If not, what\u2019s the point?<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">It Isn\u2019t Necessary.<\/h3>\n<p>The whole concept of a service provider giving a gift to the beneficiary after a job well done is unique to real estate. It\u2019s not a common practice in any other industry.<\/p>\n<p>For example, doctors, hairdressers, accountants, plumbers, lawyers \u2013 none of them give gifts to their clients after they provide their services. Perhaps because the service is the gift.<\/p>\n<p>Besides, aren\u2019t real estate closings simply another business transaction? You made the sale. In exchange for your services, you got paid a percentage of the sales price of the home. All parties are satisfied with the outcome. The end.<\/p>\n<p>If we follow this logic, it leads us to see a closing gift as just that: a gift. And by definition, that means it\u2019s unwarranted, a bonus, an extra. It might be a nice gesture or even useful for retention purposes, but it\u2019s not necessary.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">The Best (&amp; Only) Reason To Give Real Estate Closing Gifts<\/h2>\n<p>Yes, gifts show appreciation. And sure, gifting a client may feel like the \u201cright thing to do.\u201d But let\u2019s be honest. It may not always be purely altruistic. There may be ulterior motives involved in closing gifts from Realtors.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s nothing bad or wrong with that. It\u2019s perfectly okay to admit you\u2019re hoping to remain top-of-mind with the client or that you\u2019re dreaming of future referrals.<\/p>\n<p>The point here is simply to notice (and be honest about) the purpose your closing gifts serve so you can be more intentional about the gifts you choose.<\/p>\n<p>As you know, creating and nurturing strong, long-lasting relationships with your clients is essential for success in real estate. It\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/blog\/the-lost-art-of-lead-conversion\/\">how you capture and convert leads<\/a>. It\u2019s why <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/solutions\/crm\/\">you get the most robust CRM<\/a>. And it\u2019s the best reason to give real estate closing gifts.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">How To Give Real Estate Closing Gifts<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019ve decided that giving closing gifts is a good idea for your business and your clients, keep in mind that the \u201chow\u201d matters as much as the \u201cwhat.\u201d Here are some helpful tips.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">Choose the Best Time<\/h3>\n<p>Shortly after closing you\u2019re already top-of-mind with the client. Your name will come up in conversations with anyone who asks about your clients\u2019 experience buying or selling their homes.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve provided sterling customer service, expect your clients to rave about you. If you haven\u2019t, no closing gift short of a Lamborghini will change that client\u2019s opinion of you.<\/p>\n<p>So, you may want to consider waiting a good chunk of time before offering a closing gift \u2013 even six months to a year. Aim to land a gift at their doorstep right around the time you\u2019re fading from memory. Call it an \u201canniversary gift,\u201d and include a note with it that wishes them a happy anniversary on the sale or purchase of the home.<\/p>\n<p>You could say something like, \u201cI saw this while out shopping and it made me think of you \u2013 I just had to buy it. Enjoy!\u201d Then, tell them how grateful you are that they placed their trust in you and to pass your name along to anyone they know who\u2019s thinking of buying or selling.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a gift for them, and it\u2019s a gift for you: You just bought yourself another couple months in that client\u2019s memory.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">Don\u2019t Use Marketing Collateral as Your Gift<\/h3>\n<p>The odds are high that your client can tell the difference between a genuine gift and tacky marketing tchotchke. A gift like that could have a negative effect on the way they remember you next time someone asks whether they know any good real estate agents.<\/p>\n<p>Some agents give an item that\u2019s branded because it technically becomes a marketing tool, which means closing gifts from Realtors are not subject to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/publications\/p463\">IRS gift restrictions<\/a> clause. That\u2019s fine.<\/p>\n<p>But be careful not to give gifts that feel like marketing collateral. You don\u2019t want to work against the altruistic, personal-touch feeling you\u2019re trying so hard to create.<\/p>\n<p>And what do most people do with those kinds of gifts from real estate agents? That\u2019s right: they\u2019ll end up in the attic if not thrown in the trash. Your best hope is that it will show up in a thrift store where someone, anyone, will actually see it.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">Make It Personal<\/h3>\n<p>Keep each individual client in mind as you\u2019re considering the kind of gift you want to give them. Thoughtless gifts are less likely to serve the purpose you have in mind (i.e., developing a great relationship with them).<\/p>\n<p>For example, consider the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What are their likes and dislikes?<\/strong> A gift that\u2019s specifically tailored to their hobbies and interests is a great way to stand out. But again, the opposite is also true \u2013 a generic gift that has nothing to do with who they are could send you to the background.<\/li>\n<li><strong>What kinds of food and drink ideas would work?<\/strong> Be cognizant of food allergies. A box of chocolates will be appreciated by some, but to diabetics and dieters, it\u2019s not going to leave the best impression. The same holds true for alcohol. If you don\u2019t know whether or not your client is carrying a sobriety coin in his pocket, forgo that bottle of premium vodka or vintage wine.<\/li>\n<li><strong>What is home life like for them?<\/strong> The best closing gift for an elderly retiree might be very different than it would be for a young married couple with a newborn. What you give to a large family with three dogs and a cat may need to be different from what you give to a single college-aged first-time homebuyer.<\/li>\n<li><strong>What will they actually use?<\/strong> Thinking practically can give you some great ideas. The clear advantage to giving them something they can use over and over again is that it\u2019s more likely to keep you top of mind for long time.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You get the idea. Choose a gift that will show them they\u2019re not just another nameless paying customer.<\/p>\n<p>Need some inspiration to get you started? Here\u2019s a fail-proof list of both classic and unique real estate agent closing gift ideas.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">8 Thoughtful Real Estate Closing Gift Ideas<\/h2>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">Homeowner Journal<\/h3>\n<p>Rachael Hite at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.inman.com\/2015\/12\/16\/how-to-make-a-stellar-closing-gift-out-of-a-homeowner-resource\/\">Inman<\/a> does an admirable job of describing the \u201cBlack and Decker Home Planner and Logbook\u201d and why it makes a great closing gift. (There\u2019s even a spot for your brand logo.)<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">Monthly Subscriptions<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s the closing gift that keeps on giving, month after month. And, it\u2019s not just magazine subscriptions that agents are gifting. We\u2019ve seen everything from monthly maid, gardening, or pool service to subscription surprise boxes for the <a href=\"https:\/\/bodibox.com.au\/\">yoga devotee<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/jackedpack.com\/\">fitness freak<\/a> and even the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.barkbox.com\/\">dog owner<\/a>. While they can be pricey, <a href=\"https:\/\/urbantastebud.com\/best-full-meal-subscription-boxes\/\">meal subscriptions<\/a> are popular and a blessing to your client who is too busy to cook.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">Cleaning\/Organizing Services<\/h3>\n<p>This is a great idea because it\u2019s really two gifts in one. First, because everyone loves to have a clean house. And second, because it saves your client the time it takes to clean, which frees them up to enjoy a weekend out or to just relax. Companies like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mollymaid.com\/gift-certificates\/\">Molly Maid<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tidy.com\/gifts\">TIDY<\/a>, for example, offer gift cards.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">Flowers and Houseplants<\/h3>\n<p>This is a classic choice. Flowers and plants make for beautiful decoration, they\u2019re memorable, and depending on what you get, they can last a very long time.<\/p>\n<p>You almost can\u2019t go wrong. Almost. Make sure you choose a plant that isn\u2019t toxic, especially if they have small children or pets.<\/p>\n<p>You can find a list of poisonous plants, both indoor and outdoor, at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.poison.org\/articles\/plant\">Poison.org<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aspca.org\/pet-care\/animal-poison-control\/toxic-and-non-toxic-plants\">ASPCA.org<\/a>. And if you\u2019re looking for ideas, Jayme Kinsey at <a href=\"https:\/\/dengarden.com\/gardening\/Non-Toxic-House-Plants-For-Homes-Children-Cats-and-Dogs\">DenGarden.com<\/a> offers a list of non-toxic choices for kids, dogs and cats.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">Emergency Kit<\/h3>\n<p>While a home emergency kit might be a no-brainer, how about one for your commuter clients\u2019 car? One for the pets of a dog-loving homeowner?<\/p>\n<p>You can get premade kits, or to add a personal touch, they\u2019re also a fun DIY project. Get ideas and tips from the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.redcross.org\/store\/preparedness\">American Red Cross<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">Gift Cards<\/h3>\n<p>Your clients will always have a wish list of things they want to buy for their new home, and you can be the agent who helps make a wish or two come true. If you\u2019re not sure which store is their favorite, go for the failsafe big-box stores like Home Depot or Ikea.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">Season Passes<\/h3>\n<p>A season pass to a popular local venue is another great idea, especially if your client is new in town. The local water park, movie theater, children\u2019s museum, or ski lifts, for example, are sure to be a big hit.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">Gadget Gifts &amp; Techie Tools<\/h3>\n<p>Help your clients keep their house clean with a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irobot.com\/en_US\/roomba.html\">Roomba robot vacuum cleaner<\/a>. Gift them with peace of mind \u2013 give them <a href=\"https:\/\/ring.com\/products\/video-doorbell-v2\">Ring\u2019s video doorbell<\/a> or a <a href=\"https:\/\/august.com\/\">\u201csmart lock\u201d from August<\/a>.
