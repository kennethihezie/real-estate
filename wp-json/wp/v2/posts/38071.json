You\u2019ll get a universal groan \u2013 much like the one real estate agents emit when they describe what they were taught in real estate school as \u201cuseless.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Then, ask Joe Manganiello, an actor who landed a plum role as a werewolf on the HBO show \u201cTrue Blood.\u201d He\u2019ll be happy to explain how even seemingly silly aspects of acting training, such as those \u201cpretend you&#8217;re an animal\u201d exercises, can really pay off.<\/p>\n<p>The next time you sit in front of a telephone, and dread picking it up to chant, \u201cWhen do you plan on moving? How long have you lived at this address?\u201d think about Manganiello and how you, too, might end up howling at the moon over all the money you\u2019ve made \u2013 if you hire the right real estate coach.<\/p>\n<h2>How to Know If You Need a Real Estate Coach<\/h2>\n<p>If you are listing and selling real estate, chances are good you would benefit from coaching. Yes, even veterans can get something out of it. Of course the ideal time to hook up with one, though, is when you are freshly-licensed.<\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t have any idea of your production numbers from the past three years, you don\u2019t have a business plan, you don\u2019t understand your weaknesses and how to overcome them, or you are merely trying to figure out how to raise your production \u2013 you need a coach.<\/p>\n<p>Even if you don\u2019t think you\u2019d benefit from coaching, you may be surprised at how much it can help. \u201cI have an awesome coach,\u201d claims Lisa Ludlow Archer, an agent with Keller Williams in Charlotte, N.C.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLast summer I started working with Darin Persinger with Productivity Junkies. I think I am one of his prize students, only because if you could ever have an anomaly that would be me,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cI often considered myself un-coachable but it seems I am, after all.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>The Benefits of Real Estate Coaching<\/h2>\n<p>Not being able to see the forest for the trees isn\u2019t just a real estate personality quirk, but many agents seem to excel at it. Many become so involved in the details of their real estate practices that they fail to see the whole picture. An outsider \u2013 especially one that is intimately familiar with how to achieve success in the field \u2013 can see it all.<\/p>\n<p>Spencer Krull, with Teles Properties in Beverly Hills, Calif., remembers meeting Steve Shull of Performance Training years ago, when he was with Coldwell Banker. \u201cSteve talks about the obvious,\u201d Krull recalled. \u201cReal estate agents always like to complicate things and we love getting in our own way. Steve simplified the process for me,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>He also got Krull to door-knock, something he\u2019d resisted in the past. \u201cI door-knocked three times a week. It worked,\u201d Krull said. \u201cReal estate coaching is only of value if you\u2019re going to do what your coach tells you to do.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Beginner agents can learn goal setting and other basic business skills from a coach. \u201cMid-level real estate agents find incredible value in real estate coaching as they learn to break down the barriers that impede their success, open up more time in their schedules for fun, and convert more prospects into sales,\u201d Carol Mazur, a real estate trainer with Top Pro Group, says on <a href=\"https:\/\/activerain.com\/profile\/carolmazur\">her ActiveRain blog<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>From helping you come up with a business plan to showing you ways to kick your production into a higher gear, a real estate coach can bring a lot to your business.<\/p>\n<h2>Types of Real Estate Coaching<\/h2>\n<p>When considering the type of coaching you need, think about how you best learn. Are you a visual learner? If so, you may want to pursue e-courses, webinars and live workshops.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re overly busy and need to cut to the chase, many trainers offer phone support, advice and mentoring.<\/p>\n<h2>Choosing a Real Estate Coach<\/h2>\n<p>Deciding who to bare your real estate business\u2019s soul to is probably the most challenging aspect of this process. While all of the well-known trainers have their share of fans, what works for one agent may bring dismal results to another.<\/p>\n<p>Then, there is the little matter of personalities, and the type that you mesh with.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve worked with tons of coaches,\u201d says Dano Sayles with Hawaii Life Real Estate on Maui. \u201cThe first was Howard Brinton, and then I trained with Bob Corcoran of Corcoran Consulting and Coaching. I\u2019m now working with Ken Goodfellow of CKG International to come up with a strategic plan for our business.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Coldwell Banker Chicago\u2019s Jennifer Ames chose CKG International as well, to help structure her team. She speaks with her real estate coach every week about \u201cstrategic issues such as hiring a manager to manage my team, and various other ever-changing challenges in my business,\u201d she explained.<\/p>\n<p>The right coach can save a lagging real estate career. \u201cI almost got out of real estate until I found Jennifer Allen-Hagedorn,\u201d said Debb Janes, an agent with the Carl Group in Camas, Wash. \u201cJennifer made it okay for me to not want to cold call clients or bug them with drip campaigns,\u201d she said.\u00a0 Hagedorn\u2019s \u201cSell with Soul\u201d training meshed with Janes\u2019s personality and business philosophy.<\/p>\n<p>Speak with other agents in your office about their trainers to find the perfect fit for you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ask any aspiring thespian about the \u201cmovement classes\u201d their acting coaches and schools suggest they take.
