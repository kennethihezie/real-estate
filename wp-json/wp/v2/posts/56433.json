Wait\u2026 I did live it. And I distinctly recall that it sometimes felt as if I were a hamster on a wheel, going endlessly in circles.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to the wonders of physics, the hamster wheel never runs out of power, easily accommodating you on 16-hour days, going around and around.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s the trivial, everyday stuff that gets the attention while you\u2019re on the wheel and the important stuff gets short shrift.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s time to give the hamster his wheel back and focus on how you can leverage real estate technology and tools available to allow you to spend more time on the truly important aspects \u2013 <em>the money-making aspects <\/em>\u2013 of your business.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Don\u2019t be a tech laggard.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Small businesses that leverage new technology make more money than businesses that are \u201ctech laggards,\u201d according to research from <a href=\"http:\/\/image-src.bcg.com\/Images\/Ahead_of_the_Curve_Oct_2013_tcm9-94245.pdf\">The Boston Consulting Group<\/a> (BCG).<\/p>\n<p>In fact, \u201cleaders racked up annual revenue-growth rates 11 percentage points higher than laggards,\u201d according to BCG\u2019s report.<\/p>\n<p>But, don\u2019t waste your money on new tech until you have your office outfitted with the basics.
