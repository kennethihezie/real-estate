Mom and Dad bore no hard feelings, however, and the family remained in Kalamazoo for Jon\u2019s entire childhood.<\/p>\n<p>From there, it was fashion school in Los Angeles followed by a career as a department manager for large department stores.<\/p>\n<p>Snyder met her husband in Denver and they travelled the world for his job as an architect, living for a time in Pakistan, Chicago, London, and finally, Montana.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe landed in Livingston, population 7,500,\u201d she recalled. \u201cLuckily, we had lived in Jackson Hole (Wyo.) before we moved here, which also has a very small local population, so I got a taste for living in a small town,\u201d she continues.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t had that taste I don\u2019t know if we would\u2019ve lasted here. But it\u2019s a wonderful small town. It\u2019s 50 miles from Yellowstone Park and we enjoy camping and outdoor activities. There\u2019s a lot of beauty around here, plus the people are awesome. It\u2019s not the typical small town.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>From World Traveler to Small-Town Agent<\/h2>\n<p>When the couple first got to Livingston, Snyder was doing secretarial work. \u201cI enjoyed that job. Even to be a legal secretary in Livingston at the time, though, you were only making seven bucks an hour,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cI quickly learned that if you were going to make it in Montana you needed some sort of self-employment.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI happened to work with a woman who was doing a lot of real estate investing\u2026and with my husband being an architect, I just thought, well, why not get my real estate license?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That was 18 years ago, so at this point Snyder is a longtime Livingston local and knows her market very well.<\/p>\n<h2>Challenges for an Industry Veteran<\/h2>\n<p>When asked what kind of challenges she faces at the 18-year mark, Snyder shared that she struggles with finding the time for everything.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u201c<\/strong>I think the biggest challenge for me is trying to find a work-life balance,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cMarket Leader did <a href=\"\/blog\/the-happiest-agent-on-the-block\/\">that interesting survey<\/a> where it found that people that went into real estate because they wanted to make their own hours were the least happy,\u201d she continued.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re a successful Realtor\u00ae you have flexibility, but you don\u2019t make your own hours. If you are dedicated to your job and somebody wants to write a buy-sell at 9 p.m. on Sunday, and it\u2019s Christmas, you\u2019re going to do it. So, that\u2019s why you have to look for a way to find balance in your life,\u201d Snyder concluded.<\/p>\n<h2>Marketing with Market Leader<\/h2>\n<p>When Snyder started her real estate career in this small town, she didn\u2019t know a soul. So, like most new entrepreneurs, she started throwing everything possible at the wall to see what would stick.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI did things like joined the Rotary, I got on different boards, joined the Chamber of Commerce and did some newspaper advertising. \u00a0I also did a lot of direct mail,\u201d she explains. \u201cI looked for every place I could stick my face, really.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Today, she relies on her Market Leader website for new leads and on past clients for referrals. She stays in touch with former clients with a drip email campaign that is so effective, she says, that 80 percent of her business comes from people she\u2019s worked with over the past 18 years.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI have the Market leader website, which has been great at bringing in new clients,\u201d Snyder continues. \u201cThe thing that enticed me about Market Leader was before I had a website where I had to personally keep it up and that was a pain,\u201d she said. \u201cI also like that Market Leader has a mobile product and how easy it is to put people on drip campaigns.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAt first I was very leery about people having to sign up in order to continue to see information,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they do it. I find that people who are super serious about wanting to buy a house will sign up.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Out of the Office, Into the Field (Literally)<\/h2>\n<p>We asked Snyder what she likes best about being in real estate. \u201cProbably what I did this morning,\u201d she replied. \u201cWe drove up to the mountains to see a beautiful little cabin and we saw a moose along the way. All the wildflowers are out,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe thing I enjoy most is when I\u2019m out in the field showing property in this beautiful area. It\u2019s the best part of my job.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Somewhere along the line, between the hospital and the Kalamazoo County clerk\u2019s office, someone misspelled baby Jan Ellen\u2019s name and she became Jon Ellen Snyder.
