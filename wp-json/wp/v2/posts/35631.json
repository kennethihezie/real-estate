Although he\u2019s now a sales agent with Coldwell Banker in Bellevue, Wash., Meyer was once an ace account executive with us for two years before being promoted to team leader and, finally, sales manager.<\/p>\n<p>After eight years of dealing with agents\u2019 marketing needs, he decided to cross over and become a real estate agent himself.<\/p>\n<p>It takes a bit of courage to quit a well-paying job to go into commission-based sales\u2014even more so for an agent with a wife and newborn baby at home\u2014but Meyer did it, and has come out happily on the other side.<\/p>\n<p>Meyer was born in Columbus, Ohio, and is a self-described Buckeye fan. His family moved to the Kirkland, Wash., area when he was a small child, and there he has remained.<\/p>\n<h2>Life Before Real Estate<\/h2>\n<p>Meyer worked in sales for Qwest Communications (now CenturyLink) before joining Market Leader as an account executive. Entering the real estate industry had always been in the back of his mind.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d already been drawn to real estate, even before I worked for Market Leader,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI\u2019ve always had goals to build a portfolio of properties, and I\u2019ve always kind of followed the market.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOnce I started working at Market Leader, I was learning more about the industry,\u201d he continued. \u201cTalking with agents, I understood and realized the earning potential. My goals were to leave Market Leader and build a team of agents. I let them know my intentions, of course,\u201d he concluded.<\/p>\n<h2>Challenges for a New Agent<\/h2>\n<p>Meyer is now in his third year in the real estate industry. We were curious to know what challenges he is facing at this point in his career.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI thought I knew everything when I got into the business,\u201d he began. \u201cI had a list of 18 names. I was 100 percent confident that those people were going to be buying or selling a home from me, quickly. Every single day, I found myself erasing one of those names,\u201d he recalled.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEverything I thought I knew about real estate was completely wrong. It\u2019s definitely a lot harder than I thought, and a lot different than I thought,\u201d Meyer admitted.<\/p>\n<p>His biggest overall challenge, however, has been in making the transition from employee to self-employed. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to not have anyone give you direction or tell you what to do. Figuring out what I was supposed to be doing was a challenge,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<h2>Finding Clients<\/h2>\n<p>Meyer figures that he closes 26 transactions a year, at just the three-year mark in his career. He credits both Market Leader and some tried-and-true prospecting techniques for his success. \u00a0In fact, the telephone is his best friend.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA lot of agents are afraid of the phone\u2014afraid of picking up the phone and calling somebody and being rejected. I\u2019m not. I\u2019ve been in phone sales since I was 18,\u201d he said. \u201cSomebody says \u2018no,\u2019 I move on to the next one until I find somebody that says \u2018yes.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Market Leader system is great,\u201d he continued. \u201cI use it to attract clients and get people registered, so I have their contact information. Then I use the system to cultivate those relationships. I close a lot of deals through the leads I get from Market Leader.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Meyer says that he frequently hears agents complain that online leads are \u201cbad\u201d leads. \u201cEverybody complains about leads and how crummy they are from x, y, or z company. The problem isn\u2019t the leads. It\u2019s the agent. They think about them as leads that should be transacting right now. You have to cultivate online leads,\u201d he explained.<\/p>\n<h2>Life Beyond Real Estate<\/h2>\n<p>Meyer has his practice and two toddlers running his life, so he doesn\u2019t have a ton of extra time to follow his volunteer spirit. When the kids get a little older, he plans on making volunteerism a family affair by working with a cause that helps \u201ckids and\/or pets.\u201d In what little spare time he does have, he and the family hit the closest park, ride bikes and generally spend as much time together as possible.<\/p>\n<p>We asked Meyer what he enjoys most about his real estate career. \u201cThere are many things I enjoy and very little that I don\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cThe flexibility of my schedule that lets me be more involved with my family is a big deal for me.\u00a0 From a client perspective, I absolutely love helping people achieve their goals.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you\u2019re a longtime Market Leader customer, the name Kevin Meyer may be familiar to you.
