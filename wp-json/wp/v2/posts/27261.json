With both parents in the real estate industry, however, her destiny ran more to Real Estate Barbie, or so said her first broker.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI studied for my license in 1979 and got my first license in 1980. At the time I worked for Century 21 in Ontario, Calif., and I was so young and so na\u00efve,\u201d Daniel recalls. \u201cThe manager there told me that I was too young, too blonde and to come back when I was older.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>So, she did \u2013 eventually. First, Daniel worked in the grocery business, in a variety of positions. \u201cI was kind of a jack of all trades in the grocery business. I actually loved it, but it\u2019s not a very loyal business to people that wanted to be loyal to it,\u201d she said. The union and employee problems eventually took their toll, and Daniel found herself in Northern California helping to open a Keller Williams office.<\/p>\n<p>She sat once again for her real estate license exam and hasn\u2019t looked back over the past 11 years. \u201cRealty is such a part of who I am, my culture,\u201d Daniel explained. \u201cMy mom and step dad are in the business. My stepdad is a commercial broker in Phoenix and my mom is a residential broker in Phoenix, and that\u2019s all we talk about all the time; it\u2019s all-consuming,\u201d she concluded.<\/p>\n<h2>Challenges<\/h2>\n<p>Daniel is raising her grandchildren, ages 6 and 8, so her biggest challenges revolve around running a business while simultaneously raising a family. \u201cStarting over, being on call 24-7 &#8211; because you really are on call 24\/7 &#8211; it takes a toll on your psyche, on your mental well-being,\u201d she explains. \u201cRight now, at this point in time, I consciously make an effort to not work as much. Yet, if I don\u2019t work, I don\u2019t get paid. So, right now, my biggest challenge is that I\u2019m not getting paid because I\u2019m not able to work as much.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Lucky for Daniel, she found Market Leader about six years ago. Instead of hitting the pavement every day trying to drum up leads, she gets them from Market Leader, freeing up time for her to spend with the girls.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAbout 99 percent of my business is from Market Leader,\u201d Daniel said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d <em>be<\/em> in business without them.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Life Outside of Real Estate<\/h2>\n<p>Daniel, a recipient of U.S. Congressional recognition for her work with veterans, always finds time to volunteer. She\u2019s on the board of the Brentwood Police Activity League, is in the Rotary and participates in several other civic organizations.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not volunteering in your community, you\u2019re doing your neighborhood a disservice,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I won Mega Millions tomorrow, I\u2019d be a professional volunteer.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Motherhood the second time around keeps Daniel busy, and the tug of war between family and work is challenging. \u201cMy biggest challenge is wrapping my head around the fact that I don\u2019t have to be everything to everybody,\u201d she explains. \u201cIn fact, my new favorite word is \u201cnext.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Cathy Daniel, an agent in Brentwood, Calif., had a childhood dream of becoming Party Barbie.
