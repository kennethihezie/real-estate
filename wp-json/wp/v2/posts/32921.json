The median home price in Edgartown touched $801,500 in 2013, according to the Boston Globe. That\u2019s an 11.7 percent jump from the 2005 peak levels, the paper said. But, in Nantucket, which is considered an exclusive summer getaway for the rich, prices are nearly 30 percent off the peak level of $1.49 million. So, that\u2019s one place to consider, along with communities such as Hyannis, where prices are down 34 percent from the peak level of $327,000; Oak Bluffs, where they\u2019re down 25 percent from $595,000; and Yarmouth, where prices are down 20.4 percent from $327,000.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So, tell your clients that now may be the right time to invest in that vacation home or rental property.

According to the Massachusetts Association of Realtors\u00ae, Barnstable, Brewster, Centerville, Chatham, Cotuit, Harwich, Hyannis, Falmouth, Osterville, Provincetown, and Wellfleet experienced a hike in median prices, compared with the same period in 2013.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In Osterville, the median single-family home price skyrocketed 42 percent, while in Falmouth prices shot up nearly 20 percent, according to the Boston Globe.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">New Home Sales Increase<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">New home prices in April inched upward for the first time in three months, climbing 6.4 percent to a 433,000 annualized rate, according to data from the Commerce Department.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What triggered the increase was a demand for homes in the Midwest.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cThe deep freeze is over, and I think we can expect <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2014-05-23\/sales-of-new-u-s-homes-increased-6-4-in-april-to-433-000-pace\">new home sales<\/a> to continue to rise,\u201d David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide Insurance in Columbus, Ohio, who projected a 432,000 rate of April sales, told Bloomberg. \u201cIt\u2019s better; it\u2019s still not strong.\u201d<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the Midwest, home sales increased 47.4 percent to an 84,000 annual rate. That\u2019s the fastest since November 2007. Home sales also climbed 3.1 percent in the South.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are other indicators that prices are on the upswing. According to the National Association of Realtors\u00ae, sales of previously occupied homes increased 1.3 percent.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Toll Brothers Reaping Profits<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here\u2019s another positive indicator for the industry. Strong buyer demand triggered an increase in profits for homebuilder Toll Brothers. Second-quarter profits more than doubled for the company compared to a year ago. The company predicted that it will continue to fetch <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/money\/business\/2014\/05\/28\/toll-brothers-earnings\/9661173\/\">higher prices for its luxury homes<\/a> the rest of the year, according to USA Today.<\/p>\n<p>In the most recent quarter ended April 30, the company earned $65.2 million, or 35 cents per share, compared with $24.7 million, or 14 cents per share, in last year\u2019s second quarter. Analysts were expecting earnings of 27 cents per share.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The company readied 1,218 homes for the market in the second quarter. That\u2019s a 36 percent jump.
