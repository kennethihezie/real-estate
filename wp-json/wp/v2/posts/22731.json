Then, life happened.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI was a diesel mechanic,\u201d he said, \u201cfrom 1998 to 2000 in Phoenix, Arizona. I worked on generators and industrial rental equipment. I knew it wasn\u2019t something I wanted to do long-term, so I ended up going back to college.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Riddle left Phoenix and went home to Washington where he enrolled in Gonzaga University. Although he graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering, he was actually a double major. \u201cI majored in mechanical engineering with a physics minor, and I also majored in philosophy.<\/p>\n<p>Fate, once again, had other plans for this Spokane native.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI had a buddy in the real estate field,\u201d Riddle explained. \u201cHe\u2019d gone into the navy for four years after high school and then got out of the Navy and moved back home and started selling real estate.\u201d It was over lunch that Riddle\u2019s buddy suggested to him that he might enjoy a career in real estate.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI had one year of school left, so I started selling real estate between my junior and senior year of college,\u201d he said. He\u2019s never looked back.<\/p>\n<h2>A Decade Into Real Estate<\/h2>\n<p>We asked Riddle what challenges he faces at this point, almost 10 years into his career. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a challenge,\u201d he replied, \u201cI\u2019m doing some soul-searching as far as remaining committed to the industry,\u201d he continued.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a question most agents come to at some point in their careers. Do you want to be an independent agent who sells maybe a dozen homes a year, or do you head for the big leagues, selling hundreds? To what level do you have the energy and desire to take your business?<\/p>\n<p>Riddle is leaning toward owning his own brokerage someday, with 25 to 30 agents under him.<\/p>\n<h2>Riddle\u2019s Synergy<\/h2>\n<p>Right now, Riddle works with <a href=\"http:\/\/synergyrealtyspokane.com\/\">Synergy Properties<\/a>, running a team of 10 agents and three administrative folks. \u201cOne person does file transaction coordination and another gal does all the marketing for our listings,\u201d he said. His third administrative employee is what he calls his \u201cuniversal soldier.\u201d \u201cShe is in charge of helping the agents with anything they need,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Managing a team and staff doesn\u2019t leave much time for Riddle to hit the streets selling real estate. \u201cI do a lot of the managing and overseeing and business planning,\u201d he explained. But he also keeps his seven buyer\u2019s agents and three listing agents busy with the massive amount of leads he generates.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe do a lot of Web advertisement,\u201d he explained. \u201cThat\u2019s probably 80 percent of my marketing. I do some supplemental magazine advertisements in two local magazines here in Spokane, and I\u2019m just venturing into the radio field. All of the advertising I do really directs people back to my online presence,\u201d he concluded.<\/p>\n<p>The Web advertising he speaks of is mainly pay-per-click, a form of lead generation he swears by. \u201cI think it\u2019s one of the most effective forms of advertising,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe reason I say that is with pay-per-click advertising you can target your consumer. I think that\u2019s one thing that the Internet has provided us that a lot of other marketing forms don\u2019t,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf I buy a billboard on the side of the road, it\u2019s just kind of a broad message to random people,\u201d Riddle said.<\/p>\n<p>Riddle currently spends about $2,500 per month on pay-per-click ads and he figures they generate about 200 leads a month. \u201cSo, $2,500 computes to about 200 people that give me their email address, their name, possibly a contact phone number and express what they are interested in,\u201d he said. \u201cOut of those 200 or so people that log into my website and provide that information, I would say that about 3 percent of them end up buying a house through me and my company.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>A Most Valuable Tool<\/h2>\n<p>Riddle is the first to admit he\u2019d be lost without Market Leader. \u201cFor me, it is the one &#8211; if not the only &#8211; platform that I\u2019ve had for the longest amount of time,\u201d he explained. \u201cI fully integrated it into the rest of my business. It really removes a bunch of the obstacles that I faced early on with Internet lead generation with an all-in-one platform,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Riddle also credits Market Leader products with helping him keep a presence on Craigslist and with marketing his listings on his website.<\/p>\n<p>Mostly, he values the organizational aspect of his Market Leader tools. \u201cThey have a systemized way of creating campaigns so that when leads come in I can set them up on different campaigns, short-term or long-term, with messages that I can customize,\u201d Riddle said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFor each lead that comes in, there is a system where I can put in notes, I can put in reminders to follow up with them at a later date, and I can share that information with maybe a lender or other partner,\u201d he said. \u201cMarket Leader allows me to have a platform where I can control all that. So, when these hundreds of leads come in, I have the ability to really stay organized and stay on top of my communication. It\u2019s just a really great all-in-one system in my opinion.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>The Non-Real Estate Riddle<\/h2>\n<p>When he\u2019s not running a real estate team, Riddle and his wife enjoy the outdoors. \u201cI am kind of an extreme sports fanatic,\u201d he claims. \u201cI love to play as hard as I work. I like to go snowboarding and I like to go skiing; I like to surf. Anytime I can get on a board of any type, whether it\u2019s a skateboard, a snowboard or a surfboard, I am all in. I am a board kind of guy,\u201d he said, laughing.<\/p>\n<p>Riddle didn\u2019t hesitate with an answer when asked about what he enjoys most in his real estate career. \u201cThe autonomy,\u201d he said, \u201calong with the freedom and the flexibility that the industry allows. Just the thought of going back to work for someone else is horrifying to me.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>We think that\u2019s a sentiment most agents can agree with.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Keith Riddle grew up on a working farm in eastern Washington, and for most of his life he assumed he\u2019d be a farmer when he grew up.
