A website that stands out from the competition.<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having an online presence isn\u2019t an option in today\u2019s digital landscape; it\u2019s not <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">if<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you\u2019re online, it\u2019s where and what your website offers consumers that matters.

Your website can&#8217;t simply be a place to share your contact information, it needs to become a one-stop shop or their real estate needs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>2. Text message marketing campaigns.<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Real estate marketers can benefit significantly from <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.textmagic.com\/blog\/text-messaging-for-real-estate\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">real estate text messaging<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.
