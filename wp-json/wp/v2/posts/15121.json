The unique challenges of pricing, marketing and dealing with the parties are many and varied &#8211; not something one should tackle without experience.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve already taken the listing, you may want to consider cutting your office\u2019s luxury home specialist in on the deal so you can learn as you go.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a look at some of the unique challenges you\u2019ll face with your first luxury home listing.<\/p>\n<h2>Pricing Luxury Homes<\/h2>\n<p>Luxury homes are not tract homes. They aren\u2019t mass-produced by a single developer. They are typically architecture-designed and custom built.<\/p>\n<p>How will you price this type of property? The typical agent CMA is useless when determining the price of a luxury home mainly because there are few (or zero) comparables. Plus, the more custom amenities included in the home, the smaller the pool of comparables.<\/p>\n<p>Then there are the intangibles, such as view, ocean or beach access, privacy and history. How do these intangibles factor into the pricing decision?<\/p>\n<p>The most important thing you can do is to get to know the neighborhood intimately, according to luxury specialist <a href=\"http:\/\/www.davidkean.com\/\">David Kean<\/a> of Teles Properties in Beverly Hills.<\/p>\n<p>New luxury agents \u201cneed to do their research,\u201d Kean suggests. \u201cI go through every house that comes on the market so that I\u2019m not just looking at comps on paper,\u201d he continues. \u201cI have actually been through each house and I know the layout; I know if there\u2019s a telephone pole blocking the view,\u201d he concludes.<\/p>\n<p>Nancy Allen, a broker with Pacific Union GMAC Real Estate in San Francisco, starts with the basics, such as square footage (of both the house and the lot). \u201cAfter that, you need to factor in the amenities,\u201d she told Forbes.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.luxuryhomemarketing.com\/\">Laurie Moore-Moore<\/a>, founder of the Institute for Luxury Home Marketing, suggests that you pay attention to your words when working with the affluent. Many times, she claims, homeowners will argue with you over the homes you call \u201ccomparables,\u201d claiming that the homes aren\u2019t really comparable. \u201cSo, instead of referring to them as comparables, call them relevant properties,\u201d she suggests.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis small change in terminology acknowledges that these homes may be very different than the subject property, but are still the homes which are most relevant when doing a market analysis,\u201d Moore concludes.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>\n<a href=\"\/products\/real-estate-leads\/\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-44201\" src=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Blog-CTA-arrows-2.png\" alt=\"Learn more about HouseValues seller leads\"><\/a><strong><em>NEED SELLER LEADS?

These brands \u201clend credibility, endorsement and identification, in that the buyer is identifying with a certain lifestyle and taste,\u201d claims <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/id\/49638752\">John Hitchcox<\/a> of the international development firm Yoo.<\/p>\n<p>If you aren\u2019t familiar with the lifestyle of the affluent, marketing their homes will be challenging, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.senadaadzem.com\/\">Senada Adzem<\/a>, Director of Luxury Sales for Douglas Elliman in Florida.<\/p>\n<p>She advises that the new luxury agent find a mentor. \u201cThey need to offer to work for someone who is already working in that industry,\u201d she explains. \u201cThey\u2019ll learn everything from the inside out.\u201d Adzem says that to be successful with luxury sales an agent needs to immerse himself in the environment and in the peer group.<\/p>\n<p>Be nice to other agents as well as your clients,\u201d Kean suggests. \u201cIf you create a bad reputation in the luxury market, it will be very difficult for you to survive.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You\u2019ve just taken your first million-dollar-plus listing.
