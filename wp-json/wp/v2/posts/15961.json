Not so fast. Although print marketing is undoubtedly more expensive than digital campaigns, it should still be part of your overall lead generation strategy.<\/p>\n<h3>\u201cA lot of people in real estate ask, \u2018what\u2019s the best way to generate leads?\u2019\u201d says Scott Irvin, a REALTOR\u00ae with RE\/MAX in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. \u201cThere\u2019s not really one way. You\u2019ve got to hit every different avenue available to you in order to be successful.\u201d<\/h3>\n<p>And, Scott practices what he preaches. Since becoming a Market Leader customer in August of 2012, he\u2019s used the Marketing Center to put together an arsenal of print marketing pieces that he uses to reach potential clients as part of his overall marketing strategy. His creations include \u2018just listed\u2019 and \u2018just sold\u2019 postcards, a door hanger for expired listings, a monthly newsletter full of local area statistics, tips for buyers and sellers, and listing spotlights that he produces independently.<\/p>\n<p><strong>He believes that there are three key best practices for creating successful print campaigns.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>1. Testing your marketing messages<\/h2>\n<p>\nPrint marketing costs money, and for that reason alone, it\u2019s important to start by doing small print runs to <strong>test your messaging<\/strong>. Based on the response rate you receive, you\u2019ll know what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not. That way, you can allocate the bulk of your marketing budget to the messaging that\u2019s most effective, giving you the most bang for your buck.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI do a lot of testing to see what works,\u201d says Scott. \u201cWhatever is working is what I\u2019m going to continue on with and fine-tune.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>2. Maintaining consistency and patience<\/h2>\n<p>\nSecond, <strong>consistency is key<\/strong>. And patience. Sending a prospect one single postcard is rarely enough to convert them into a client.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe key is communicating over the course of six months, or maybe even longer,\u201d says Scott. \u201cFor example, I got a lead from Market Leader back in September of 2012 and it just now turned into $20,000 in commission, between the new home the buyer purchased and selling their old house. It took eight months to develop the relationship. You\u2019ve got to reach out and touch with consistency.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>3. Using a clear, concise call to action<\/h2>\n<p>\nAnother important strategy is knowing what potential clients are looking for and providing a powerful call-to-action. For example, the number one thing that buyers are looking for is access to listings. And, sellers are always in search of the value of their current home as well as recent comps for their neighborhood. Your print marketing pieces should always speak to these needs.<\/p>\n<p>And, your <strong>call-to-action should always be clear and concise <\/strong>and direct potential clients to your website, where you\u2019ll be able to collect more information about their wants, needs, and potential timeline for buying or selling.<\/p>\n<p>Print marketing can be an effective strategy, even for agents working with limited marketing budgets. \u201cYes, print marketing is an investment,\u201d admits Scott. \u201cBut, it\u2019s another way of getting yourself in front of prospective clients. I would suggest that, at the very least, everyone do at least \u2018just listed\u2019 and \u2018just sold\u2019 postcards. They\u2019re a must for everyone.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Check out additional resources on using print marketing:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"Find Your Ideal Clients\" class=\"format_text entry-content\" href=\"http:\/\/files.marketleader.com\/pdfs\/FindYourIdealClientsGrid.pdf\">Find your Ideal Clients<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a title=\"Print and online marketing: using an integrated strategy\" class=\"format_text entry-content\" href=\"http:\/\/files.marketleader.com\/pdfs\/WP_PrintedMaterials-sm.pdf\">Print and online marketing: using an integrated strategy<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With email marketing that can be sent with the click of a button, lightning-fast social media tools, and the myriad other ways to generate leads online, is print marketing a thing of the past?
