Experts chalk it up to the overuse of email marketing, but direct mail outperforms <em>most<\/em> digital marketing tactics, according to the <a href=\"https:\/\/thedma.org\/marketing-insights\/response-rate-report\/\">Association of National Advertisers<\/a> (ANA).<\/p>\n<p>Direct mail marketing\u2019s \u201cresponse rate ranges from about five to nine times greater than that of email, paid search, or social media,\u201d according to the pros at datatargetingsolutions.com.<\/p>\n<p>Pretty impressive, right? Yet, at least in the real estate industry, it seems to be a very well-kept secret.<\/p>\n<p>This leaves the door wide open for agents seeking an additional marketing vehicle and a way to stand out from the crowd.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>People Trust Direct Mail<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>A couple of years ago, the folks at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketingsherpa.com\/article\/chart\/channels-customers-trust-most-when-purchasing\">MarketingSherpa.com<\/a> conducted a\u00a0 study to determine \u201cwhich advertising channels consumers trust most and least when making purchases.\u201d The results are quite interesting:<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_57359\" style=\"width: 1148px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketingsherpa.com\/article\/chart\/channels-customers-trust-most-when-purchasing\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-57359\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-57359 size-full\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Marketing-Sherpa-Chart.png\" alt=\"Here\u2019s a chart that suggests, in real estate, direct mail may be the most trusted advertising channel.\" width=\"1138\" height=\"635\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-57359\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: MarketingSherpa<\/p><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Notice how all of the channels that have been pronounced \u201cdead\u201d top everything digital. Interestingly, 43 percent more of the respondents trust direct mail than Facebook and other social media ads.<\/p>\n<p>Since trust is something high on the list of qualities that real estate consumers seek in an agent, maybe it\u2019s time to add something \u201cnew\u201d to the marketing mix.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Real Estate Mailers: What to Send<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>When I separate my mail every day, I put the garbage-looking mail in one pile and the stuff I\u2019ll read in another. Every month I receive a market update from a real estate team here in town and that goes in the keep pile.<\/p>\n<p>I enjoy learning what my home might be worth by comparing it to recently sold homes. I can\u2019t for the life of me remember the couple\u2019s name that sends me this report and I trash it after reading it.<\/p>\n<p>Would I use them to sell my home? Never. Although I respect their consistency in mailing to me each month for the past three years, the report is ugly. It appears to be an Excel graph that they\u2019ve reproduced on their office copier.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes they don\u2019t even bother to center the paper in the copier and the image is crooked. It\u2019s in black and white on flimsy paper.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, if they put such little care into how they market themselves, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll take a chance and hope that they\u2019ll put more effort into marketing my home.<\/p>\n<p>But they do get one thing right: they send it in a business-sized envelope without branding, and they send it consistently.<\/p>\n<p>A recent ANA\/DMA study of direct mail response rates finds that the old-fashioned business-sized envelope (also known as \u201cletter-sized\u201d and #10) \u201cproduced the best median response rate overall \u2013 15.1%.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Use these for your sales letters, newsletters and other items printed on paper. Don\u2019t brand the envelopes; hand address each.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, it sounds labor- and time-intensive, and it is. But if it increases the chance that recipients will open your mail, it\u2019s worth all the time it takes.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Real Estate Postcards<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Scientists at Temple University\u2019s Fox School of Business, Center for Neural Decision Making and the U.S. Postal Service Office of Inspector General (OIG) teamed up to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.uspsoig.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/document-library-files\/2015\/rarc-wp-15-012.pdf\">study<\/a> the circumstances under which email or direct mail was more effective.<\/p>\n<p>Postcards were more effective in five of the nine tests performed.<\/p>\n<p>If you include postcards in your real estate mailing campaign, choose unusual shapes and sizes to help them stand out in the pile of mail most of us receive.<\/p>\n<p>Be aware, though, that these may cost more to mail than it does to send a standard postcard. \u201cGenerally, mailpieces [sic] that are 1\/4-inch thick or less MUST be rectangular. Pieces more than 1\/4-inch thick do not have to be rectangular,\u201d to avoid increased cost, according to the <a href=\"https:\/\/pe.usps.com\/businessmail101?ViewName=MailpieceShape\">U.S. Postal Service<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Use postcards with powerful images (local images if possible) and little text. The time-tested Just Listed and Just Sold postcards still work, but consider a postcard containing just your most compelling testimonial and contact information.<\/p>\n<h4>Other ideas we\u2019ve learned from agents who use direct mail include:<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h5>An invitation to your event<\/h5>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<h5>Invitation to an open house<\/h5>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<h5>A map of the recipients\u2019 neighborhood, dotted with \u201cpins\u201d denoting recent listings and sales.<\/h5>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><strong>Real Estate Fliers<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Consider oversized cards or even fliers with your message on one side and something of value to the recipient on the other.
