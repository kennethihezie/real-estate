As he jets between his home base in San Diego and the site of his team in Tucson, it\u2019s safe to say that Taylor has hit his stride.<\/p>\n<p>An El Paso, Texas native, Taylor got a job as a copy clerk in a Tucson mortgage firm and from there worked his way up the chain of command until he was the one giving the commands. \u201cI started as essentially a copy clerk, packaging files,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThen I became a loan processor and then a loan officer, and then in 2005 I actually bought the company.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He ran his company for about five years, and although he says he learned a lot about real estate and enjoyed what he was doing, he also learned he has an innate antipathy to paperwork and the numbers side of the mortgage industry. Since relationships were his hot button, the transition to selling residential real estate was natural.<\/p>\n<h2>6 Years of Trying<\/h2>\n<p>Taylor had obtained his real estate license in 2004, although at that time it wasn\u2019t required of mortgage agents in Arizona. When he finally got to use his license he spent the next couple of years performing between 10 and 30 transactions a year. In the middle of 2010, Taylor met with his broker and asked how he could grow his business. \u201cI was getting frustrated because no matter how hard I worked, I still made the same amount of money,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI wanted to do more and I didn\u2019t know how.\u201d It turned out that his broker didn\u2019t know how either, so Taylor hit the streets, interviewing other brokers.<\/p>\n<p>After meeting with managing brokers of all the major players in town, he decided on Keller Williams. \u201cThe only company that told me, \u2018Yes, here\u2019s step one, here\u2019s step two and three, and this will lead to your result,\u2019 was Keller Williams.<\/p>\n<p>He did 50 transactions his first year with Keller Williams and 100 during his second year. He attributes that increase in production to joining Keller Williams and following their proven system.<\/p>\n<h2>Another Proven System<\/h2>\n<p>His association with Keller Williams provided Taylor with what he calls a \u201cnatural step\u201d to adopting Market Leader products in his business. \u201cJust like Keller Williams, Market Leader has a proven system,\u201d he affirms. \u201cWhen we added in that component, last year we did almost $200,000 in commission income &#8211; just off our Market Leader website.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Taylor calls his Market Leader products a \u201cleveraged form of lead generation. There are a million ways to find clients,\u201d he says, \u201cbut the nice thing about Market Leader is that it\u2019s fairly hands-free. You tell them what zip code you want to work within, and they do all the heavy lifting and deliver you people who are either looking to buy or sell in those zip codes, depending on what you want. Life\u2019s pretty easy.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Biggest Challenge<\/h2>\n<p>We know that Keller Williams and Market Leader make Taylor\u2019s working life easier. So, what challenges does he face at the decade-mark in his career?<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFinding talent,\u201d he says without hesitation. \u201cThe thing that the public and most people don\u2019t realize about the real estate industry is that most of the agents that you see out there are very unproductive. They\u2019re selling one, two or three houses a year, and that\u2019s why our industry gets such a bad rap. They\u2019re not super professional because they don\u2019t get a lot of practice,\u201d Taylor continues.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSo for an agent to go beyond 30 houses a year it takes leverage through the right people. You have to have people on your team to help you with buyers, to help get listings online and in management. It really becomes this whole independent small business rather than just a personal services sales job,\u201d he continues. \u201cThe key to that is finding talented people. It\u2019s just like any other small business; your people will either make you or break you.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The bigger challenge, he concludes, is creating enough opportunity to retain the talent he recruits, which is his goal every day.<\/p>\n<h2>The Taylor Team<\/h2>\n<p>Though Taylor is a recruiter and trainer at his home office in San Diego, he runs a well-oiled real estate team in Tucson. The team includes an executive assistant whom he refers to as the \u201cair traffic controller,\u201d a listing coordinator, a short sale manager, and six buyer agents. Then, there\u2019s Veronica, his team CEO. Taylor credits her with running the team while he goes back and forth between Arizona and Southern California.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, it\u2019s a large team, but Taylor compares the way he does real estate to a doctor\u2019s practice. \u201cWhen you walk in, it\u2019s not your doctor that greets you at the front desk and then turns around and takes your blood pressure &#8211; and then he\u2019s running around doing the accounting and taking out the trash in between seeing patients,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<h2>Time Off<\/h2>\n<p>Madison &#8211; that\u2019s who Taylor says he spends 90 percent of his time with when he\u2019s not at the office. She\u2019s only four, so she keeps Dad hopping during his off-time. Taylor also enjoys flying airplanes and racing cars and motorcycles. \u201cIf it has an engine and you can hurt yourself in it, I\u2019m in,\u201d he said, laughing.<\/p>\n<h2>The Best Advice<\/h2>\n<p>I asked Taylor about the best advice he received as a rookie. \u201cAs a rookie I was given no advice or else I\u2019d be a lot more successful now!\u201d he said, chuckling. \u201cThroughout the entire time I\u2019ve been an agent probably the best advice I\u2019ve received is that growth is nothing,\u201d Taylor claims. As is his habit, he pulls in an aviation analogy.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen a pilot is sitting on the runway, he actually has to give it 100 percent throttle to get up to speed to take off or else the plane will never leave the ground,\u201d Taylor begins. \u201cBut then once he\u2019s at cruising altitude, he can maintain 100 or 200 or 500 miles an hour at 45 or 50 percent throttle. But, then again, if he wants to climb or go faster, he\u2019s got to give it 150 percent the effort. That\u2019s true in the real estate business and really any time you\u2019re going to grow.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>A Peek Into the Future<\/h2>\n<p>Taylor\u2019s long-term career goals include building the San Diego office to be the No. 1 office in the Southern California region, then shooting for the No. 1 office in the Keller Williams system.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBeyond that, I look forward to doing more coaching and teaching and giving back to people,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know, 10 years from now the key to success for me is that when I wake up in the morning, it\u2019s my choice what I do that day. I\u2019m living my agenda.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Although he\u2019s been kicking around the real estate business for 13 years, Jerimiah Taylor, a Keller Williams recruiter and trainer, is just now hitting the decade mark as a licensed real estate salesperson.
