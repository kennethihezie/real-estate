And when it comes to real estate leads, \ufb01rst impressions are more than just important\u2014they\u2019re crucial to your success.<\/p>\n<p>In the real estate industry, much time is spent focusing on the strategy behind building your brand, generating leads, negotiating, and closing sales. But what about the part in between \ufb01nding leads and negotiating sales? What about the period of time when you\u2019ve already found the lead, but you haven\u2019t yet started building the relationship?<\/p>\n<p>Making a \ufb01rst impression with potential clients is so much more than just returning phone calls and cleaning out your inbox. Your \ufb01rst impression can help a potential client start to trust you, establish you as an expert in your local market, and secure your role as his or her real estate professional. Consider these tips for a successful \ufb01rst encounter with a future client:<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">1. Respond Quickly\u2014\u201cSpeed to Lead\u201d Is Essential<\/h2>\n<p>Between social media, online shopping, and information at the push of a button, today\u2019s consumer expects fast, e\ufb03cient service. This why speed to lead is so important in real estate. The quicker you respond to emails, phone calls, texts, new online leads, social media messages, and Zillow messages, the more likely you are to convert that lead into a client.<\/p>\n<hr style=\"border-top: 1px solid #41464D; border-width: 1px; margin: 20px 0px;\" \/>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Keep in mind:<\/span><\/h3>\n<h4>\u2022 86% of leads believe response time is \u201cextremely important\u201d when choosing their agent.<\/h4>\n<h4>\u2022 You\u2019re 100x more likely to reach a lead than if you respond in 5 minutes versus 1 hour.<\/h4>\n<h4>\u2022 31% of leads expected a real estate agent to reply instantly to their online inquiry.<\/h4>\n<hr style=\"border-top: 1px solid #41464D; border-width: 1px; margin: 20px 0px;\" \/>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">2. Pick up the Phone Whenever Possible<\/h2>\n<p>If a lead contacts you via telephone, <strong>do not let it go to voicemail<\/strong> unless you are with a client. Many consumers won\u2019t leave you a message and will move on to another agent if you don\u2019t answer their call right away. If you are away or with a client, be sure to either text or set up an away message that says you will be in contact shortly.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">3. Respond in the Same Way That Leads Contact You<\/h2>\n<p>People reach out to you in a way that is most comfortable and e\ufb03cient for them, so it can be bene\ufb01cial to respect their choice when contacting them for the \ufb01rst time. It\u2019s long been a best practice to respond back in the manner that the lead reached out to you. If a contact sends you an email, respond via email. If he or she sends you a text message, text back and then suggest a phone call. If someone reaches out on the phone, call back.<\/p>\n<p>However, data is increasingly showing that response time is the most important factor in converting online leads. If comes down to a decision of quick response or responding in the same manner as the lead reached out, go with speed. Your pipeline will thank you for it.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">4. Make Sure Leads Know How To Contact You<\/h2>\n<p>Give leads multiple ways to get in contact with you\u2014by phone, text, email, or social media to make it most convenient for them. You want to show them that you are available and ready to address any of their needs.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">5. Prove Your Value From the Very Beginning<\/h2>\n<p>Balance the need to respond as quickly as possible and respond with the information the potential client is looking for. If possible, have all relevant information in front of you. Prove your value and expertise from the very \ufb01rst conversation. Leave your lead with information he or she didn\u2019t have before the call &#8212; a CMA, school district information, a listing detail, or other valuable materials.<\/p>\n<p>If you are out and not able to collect the information requested, contact the lead right away and let them know that you are collecting the information that they\u2019re looking for, but that you are happy to answer any other questions they may have. Then, follow-up on your word and get back to them as soon as you can with the other requested information.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">6. Have Your Own List of Questions<\/h2>\n<p>Your new lead will likely have a list of questions for you. But, make sure you have questions prepared for them. What are they looking for in a home? What makes now the right time to buy or sell? What are their must-haves? Are they a \ufb01rst\u2013time buyer or seller?<\/p>\n<p>Asking questions that allow you to best serve them will work wonders for both of you. They&#8217;ll feel valued and like you truly care about what is important to them, and having as much information as possible will allow you to work smarter and faster for them.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">7. Consider That There May Be Multiple Decision Makers<\/h2>\n<p>In most real estate transactions there are multiple people tasked with making a decision, whether it\u2019s a couple, family members, parents helping their children buy a \ufb01rst home, or friends buying a vacation property together. Make sure you know who is involved so that you don\u2019t overlook important parties.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">8. Respect Their Schedule<\/h2>\n<p>Yes, your new lead is looking to buy or sell a home. But they also have other things going on in their lives. If you pick up the phone to call a lead and he or she sounds busy, ask, \u201cCan I call you back at a time that is more convenient for you?\u201d Then, always call back at the agreed-upon time.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">9. Be Patient<\/h2>\n<p>When a contact reaches out to you, it doesn\u2019t always mean he or she is ready to buy or sell today. In some cases, it takes over a year for a lead to become active. The way you approach and handle \ufb01rst contact tells your lead a lot about the way you do business\u2014if you&#8217;re pushy and aggressive, they\u2019ll work with someone else.<\/p>\n<p>Never brush o\ufb00 a lead that isn&#8217;t transaction-ready. Take the time to answer their questions, build the foundation for a relationship, and nurture them until they want to buy or sell a home with you. Consider it an investment in your future business.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">10. Ensure All Your Leads Are in Your CRM<\/h2>\n<p>Once you hang up the phone or click send, take the time to enter your new lead into your <a href=\"\/products\/professional-for-agents\/\">real estate CRM<\/a>, if they aren\u2019t in it already. Keeping track of every single lead helps you manage your leads and nurture them until they\u2019re ready to buy or sell.<\/p>\n<p>Remember that you\u2019re not just selling a home, you\u2019re selling yourself and the partnership you provide your clients.<\/p>\n<p>For more information and tips on real estate leads, check out our <a href=\"\/blog\/category\/real-estate-leads\/\">lead generation and nurturing blog<\/a> and\u00a0<a href=\"\/resources\/\">resources center<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Whether you\u2019re making social connections at a party or interviewing for a new job, \ufb01rst impressions are everything.
