She enjoyed the creative outlet her work provided until disaster struck: \u201cMy hands gave out,\u201d she recalled. She was diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome in both hands.<\/p>\n<p>With that door slammed shut, real estate beckoned. \u201cI took the real estate courses online, took the test and, voil\u00e0! I\u2019m a Realtor\u00ae,\u201d said Gilligan.<\/p>\n<p>Gilligan, a native of Utica, N.Y., refuses to look back to her floral days. \u201cI had a very, very good summer,\u201d she said. In fact, freeing up extra time is one of the challenges she\u2019s facing right now.<\/p>\n<h2>The Secret to Her Success<\/h2>\n<p>Gilligan was introduced to Market Leader products during her first year in real estate. She didn\u2019t know a soul in town. \u201cI didn\u2019t know where I was or how to get anywhere, so Market Leader really got me on board.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>After buying leads, she started getting buyers. \u201cMy office poo-poo\u2019d it \u2013 they thought it was terrible that I was doing something like that. I said, \u2018You know what? If I sell one property, it\u2019ll pay for the whole year.\u2019 I did sell properties. I have to say it does work \u2013 I\u2019m proof,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>In the past couple of years, Gilligan has learned how to convert those leads, and instantly responding is a must. \u201cI had four closings last month and would not have had all of these buyers without Market Leader,\u201d she continued. In fact, she has been so successful that she teaches new Keller Williams agents in her office how to get their businesses off and running.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOne of the things I promote is buying listings,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt\u2019s worth it to put out the money and have one closing that pays for it and the rest is gravy. Why <em>wouldn\u2019t <\/em>anyone do this?\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Spare Time? In Real Estate?<\/h2>\n<p>When she can, Gilligan enjoys spending time with her grandkids. \u201cIt\u2019s like reliving having little kids again; I love it,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>She also tries to find ways to give back to the community and feels that Keller Williams is the ideal company to work with in that regard. \u201cKeller Williams is big on this,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a give-back real estate company.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>A Peek Into the Future<\/h2>\n<p>I asked Gilligan where she sees herself a decade from now.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll probably have some people under me, like a buyer\u2019s agent, maybe an administration person,\u201d she began. \u201cI was so busy this year I could hardly keep up with it. I found that I was spending so many hours on transactions and just keeping everything going,\u201d she continued. \u201cI have five deals pending right now, plus I have listings and buyers I\u2019m working with. If I continue to do as well as I am, and I think I will, there will be some point in time where I\u2019m going to need some help,\u201d Gilligan concluded.<\/p>\n<h2>The Best Part of Real Estate<\/h2>\n<p>Gilligan loves pretty much everything about her real estate career, but a few aspects are close to her heart.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI am the type of person that likes to go into homes and give ideas on how to stage them,\u201d she claimed.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThen, it\u2019s always fun to see someone happy, whether it is from selling their home and moving on or a brand new buyer that\u2019s just ecstatic about having their own home.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Overall, she likes the variety a career in real estate offers. \u201cI learn something new every day,\u201d Gilligan said. \u201cI like the fact that every transaction is different, every person I meet is different. It\u2019s always fun. I\u2019ll be selling real estate until I can\u2019t.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s interesting how when one of life\u2019s doors closes, another opens.
