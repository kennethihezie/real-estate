Facebook leads can be organic or paid, via advertising. Most real estate professionals have a Facebook Business page and are aware of the platform\u2019s ever-changing algorithm, with increasingly diminished organic reach and engagement. This makes Facebook today mostly pay-to-play, meaning if you\u2019re not putting advertising dollars behind posts, they won\u2019t get in front of many people.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook&#8217;s advertising platform can be resource intensive and requires the following, at minimum:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Facebook Business page<\/li>\n<li>Facebook Ads Manager ad account<\/li>\n<li>Understanding of Ads Manager\n<ul>\n<li>Ad sets<\/li>\n<li>Campaigns<\/li>\n<li>Targeting &amp; demographics<\/li>\n<li>Ad formats and media: Image, video, carousel, or collection<\/li>\n<li>How to export Facebook leads and import them into your CRM<\/li>\n<li>Facebook ad policies<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<hr \/>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/products\/professional-for-agents\/\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-44201\" src=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Blog-CTA-arrows-2.png\" alt=\"Learn more about Market Leader Professional\" \/><\/a><strong><em>Did you know? <\/em><\/strong>Market Leader customers can tap into 1.8 billion active users without spending any time in Facebook Ads Manager.

The more touchpoints you have with consumers, the more equity you will build.<\/p>\n<p>The quality of information you get from a Facebook lead tends to be more accurate as well because it is captured on-site, and populated by information from user profiles.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Converting Facebook leads<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The luxury of Facebook leads is the quality of information you receive associated with them. Because leads are generated on-site, contact information is typically automatically populated from that lead\u2019s Facebook profile. This means you\u2019re less likely to receive fake names and phone numbers.<\/p>\n<p>While generating Facebook leads might be slightly different from generating other online leads, the process of converting them is similar.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Listen<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Despite the wealth of knowledge you have to share, this process is about them. Ask questions and avoid selling them. Listening builds trust by allowing a person to feel heard and valued, which, in turn, will lower their guard and make it easier to build a real connection.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Learn<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve disarmed a lead, try to understand their preferences, interests, expectations. What do they want from you? What are their expectations of the buying or selling process?<\/p>\n<p>Ask open-ended questions and give pause. Allow the other person to fully respond and think about the things they\u2019re saying. It\u2019s not uncommon for people to talk themselves right into the decision-making process that you were hoping to guide them through; you just need to give them the chance.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Engage<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Engagement is where connections are built. It goes beyond the immediate conversation, whether face-to-face or digital, to forge a long-term relationship. It\u2019s important to ask yourself if you\u2019re engaging with people in meaningful ways, both verbally and nonverbally. Are you following up after conversations, however brief? Follow up with resources you think might be valuable to them; this will show you were listening to learn about them and want to provide value. The simple act of sending someone a follow-up text or email can mean a lot. Whether you\u2019re thanking them for their time or simply telling them it was great to chat, the effort can leave a positive impression and let them know that they\u2019re top-of-mind, after the conversation has ended.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Nurture<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Consumers want to connect with businesses before they work with them. The key to building a connection is making your interactions about them and avoiding trying to sell them too soon. Offer value, information, and any resources you can to start earning trust right off the bat.<\/p>\n<p>Is your lead responding to a listing or recently sold listing? Ask what they\u2019re looking for, put them on a campaign to send them similar listings in their target area. Have they shown interest in the home buying or selling process? Send them more resources.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Stay Top-of-Mind with\u00a0Campaigns &amp; Automation<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Your CRM should have marketing campaigns and automation built-in. For instance, Market Leader offers a complete marketing suite that is preloaded with your company logo and branding, a library of beautifully designed postcards, flyers, greeting cards, business cards, guides, and video-enabled, mobile-responsive emails to automatically put leads on integrated, multi-touch campaigns that start engaging as soon as they&#8217;re in your system.<\/p>\n<p>With an MLS integration known as IDX technology, you can set leads up to receive listing alerts for properties that match their search criteria. Listing alerts are an agent&#8217;s most valuable engagement tool. Not only does it keep a contact coming back to your website where you can track their behaviors, it helps you stay top-of-mind so when they&#8217;re ready to list or start actively searching, you are their go-to agent.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As the world\u2019s largest social media platform, with over 258 million active users across North America, Facebook offers an unrivaled opportunity to get in front of consumers, right where they are.
