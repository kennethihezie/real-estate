place) ways to do things differently.\u00a0 They\u2019ll appreciate your openness, and I guarantee you\u2019ll hear ideas that will make things better.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are no bad ideas: <\/strong>A clich\u00e9, I know, but it\u2019s important to get effective collaboration from your team.\u00a0 Make sure everyone on the team has a safe environment to share ideas.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Use team collaboration software:<\/strong> Make communications and sharing easier, faster and more efficient by using online tools that share ideas, project status, edits and more.\u00a0 Of course I\u2019m biased, but I encourage you to look at Team Leader as an option for this.\u00a0 Find something that will work for your team.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Give your team the time &amp; place to have fun too:<\/strong> It can\u2019t be all business, all the time.\u00a0 Give your team a chance to get to know each other outside of the day to day activities.\u00a0 In my role I travel from time to time and find that I build great relationships with my team when we have time to do things outside the norm (casual lunch, seeing the local sights, or just sharing a cab and getting to know them as a person).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I look forward to any comments or feedback on what you do with your teams to make them more productive and highly functioning.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We\u2019ve all worked with and on teams that just don\u2019t click, and the results reflect it.\u00a0 But sometimes, we find ourselves on a team that just works \u2013 that works well together, gets things done, and exceeds their goals.\u00a0 In any company getting a team to work together well requires good leadership.\u00a0\u00a0 And this is [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":6,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_et_pb_use_builder":"","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":""},"categories":[97,36],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/322"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/6"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=322"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/322\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=322"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=322"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=322"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
