If you\u2019re anything like <a href=\"https:\/\/timhouk.com\/\">Tim Houk<\/a> with Keller Williams in Baton Rouge, La., it takes hard work, long hours and a thorough plan to build a team.<\/p>\n<h2>The Path to Real Estate<\/h2>\n<p>Tim started life in Baton Rouge, where he grew up with dreams of becoming a veterinarian. Instead, he found himself in the Navy, where he remained for six years.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I got out of the service I got into the restaurant business,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI wanted to open a restaurant, so I waited tables and worked my way into management.\u201d The reality of running a restaurant hit head-on with the dream, however.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I started running a restaurant, I realized that it was absolutely miserable. The hours were terrible &#8211; working shift work, weekends, lots of late nights. There was no consistency, and it was just something I didn\u2019t want to do for the rest of my life,\u201d Houk said.<\/p>\n<p>He landed in the mortgage business where, on the advice of others, he considered a career in real estate.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI went back to the restaurant business at night,\u201d he said, \u201cand did real estate in the daytime.\u201d He did double duty like this for about six months until he was able to devote all his time to real estate.<\/p>\n<h2>Growing Pains<\/h2>\n<p>We asked Houk about the challenges he currently faces in his real estate practice. \u201cEvery time we seem to grow a little bit we take a step back,\u201d he said. \u201cOur production has gone up 25 to 30 percent every year, but growth in management has proven to be a challenge.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Houk team currently consists of Houk, an executive assistant, a transaction coordinator and a buyer\u2019s agent.<\/p>\n<p>The team uses the Internet almost exclusively for marketing the business and works their sphere extensively.<\/p>\n<p>Their reach-out to former clients includes client events, such as a huge crawfish boil held at Houk\u2019s home. He includes vendors on the invitation lists as well as past clients.<\/p>\n<p>For new clients who don\u2019t come from their sphere, he holds housewarming parties. \u201cThe clients give us a list of 25 names for an invitation list. These names go into our database. We then mail out the invitations,\u201d he continues. \u201cWe host a party, providing food and drinks. We get to meet all the people we invited and the buyer gets gifts from everyone we invited. It brings in a lot of referrals,\u201d Houk concluded.<\/p>\n<p>Houk also credits his business practices when it comes to building referrals. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever sold somebody a house that they didn\u2019t belong in,\u201d he said. \u201cI help people make sound financial decisions and get into the right house, and it helps us tremendously. I think that\u2019s why our referrals are so high.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Work\/Life Balance and Future Goals<\/h2>\n<p>When he isn\u2019t selling real estate in Baton Rouge, you may find Houk on the beach or biking around Santa Monica, Calif. \u201cIt\u2019s my Zen spot,\u201d he said, chuckling. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is. I hike, bike, hit the ocean, eat, marinate.\u201d He also enjoys Austin, Texas, and says that if he had to choose between the two, he\u2019d have a tough time.<\/p>\n<p>Most of all, Houk loves to cook and is working on a cookbook. He still has dreams of the restaurant industry as well, which came out when I asked him where he sees himself a decade from now.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI know I\u2019m a glutton for punishment, but I want a small restaurant where my friends and family can come and hang out and have some good food,\u201d he confessed. Will he cook there? Nope &#8211; he\u2019s learned how to delegate.<\/p>\n<p>He also wants to reach the point in his business where he is selling a house every day. The long hours required to reach that goal don\u2019t scare him a bit.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBetween military and restaurants I was working 18 hours a day, so 50 to 60 hours a week is easy,\u201d he claims.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou put in the time and you get rewarded, if you do it smart. There was a time I was working 80 hours a week in real estate. That\u2019s when I started hiring talented people, and it made my world a lot better. Most of the time now I\u2019m working 50 hours a week, he said. He considers that the perfect schedule.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>So, how does a real estate agent obtain a 70 percent referral rate and close a deal every three days?
