However, experts say that we can expect the market to shift back up in 2010. In fact, many regions hit the bottom of the market mid 2009 and are already working towards a more positive real estate climate.<\/p>\n<p>Every area and neighborhood has its own set of circumstances that affect when they finally make the upward turn. But there\u2019s no mistaking the fact that nearly all agents everywhere are anticipating a long-awaited change in the market. And change means opportunity. To capture the lucrative opportunities of 2010, it\u2019s essential for agents to make a plan, create a system, and follow through to gain the competitive edge during this crucial time.<\/p>\n<p>How do you know whether your market is shifting? Unfortunately, it\u2019s hard to tell for <strong><em>sure<\/em><\/strong> until the market is well underway. However, there\u2019s no missing the positive signs when they occur: inventories\u00a0 decrease, homes sell more quickly, and mortgage rates are generally favorable to buyers.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s always important to remain realistic: in 2010 we will not return to the hair-afire buyers\u2019 market of a few years ago. But preparation is the key to success, and here\u2019s what you just might look forward to in 2010:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Lots of questions\u2014and a little skepticism<\/strong>.
