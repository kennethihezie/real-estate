The following are a few techniques to quickly grow your Twitter followers:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Provide a bio<\/strong>. Your <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Market_Leader\">Twitter bio<\/a> is the first and often only place users look to find out a little about you, and it provides context to your tweets. Most people want to know more about you than just your tweets before following you. \u00a0Use keywords that your customers and prospects may use in their searches (if the keyword is important to you in Google, it\u2019s important in Twitter).<br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/www.exoticaquarium.com\/images\/_site\/twitter_logo.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"294\" height=\"294\" \/><\/li>\n<li><strong>Link to your Twitter profile <em>everywhere<\/em><\/strong>. More links mean more opportunities for someone to click through and follow you. The more links the better, including <a href=\"\/solutions\/customizable-websites\/\">your website<\/a>, blog, <a href=\"https:\/\/activerain.com\/blogs\/marketleader_danae\">ActiveRain profile<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/market-leader\/\">LinkedIn<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/marketleader\/\">Facebook<\/a>, email signature and anywhere else you can.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Encourage retweets.<\/strong> Tell your followers how much you appreciate it when they retweet your links. Through retweeting, more non-followers can see the type of content you post and review your profile. Often they will be inspired to follow you. \u00a0If you see someone has retweeted your content, thank them publicly (which in turn will allow you to promote their own Twitter feed).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Put it in print<\/strong>. Add your Twitter account to your business cards, flyers and other printed marketing materials.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Be helpful<\/strong>. When you provide useful information, followers are much more likely to retweet\u2014and those who read the retweets will be more likely to start following you. Ask yourself if every post is adding valuable information or perspective. Remember to use hash tags (e.g. #realestate, #activerain, etc.)\u00a0to put your content in front of others who might be interested in what you have to say.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Twitter is all about connections, the more the merrier. By encouraging those connections and by showing how much you value them, you can look forward to growing your follower count\u2014and your influence, too.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You probably already know that social media is a cost-effective way to drive traffic to your website and receive more prospects to grow your sphere of influence.
