Understanding social media algorithms on each platform can seem daunting. Not only does each platform prioritize different types of interactions, their algorithms prioritize different types of content.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re creating a content or social media marketing strategy, be sure to identify your goals for each channel, and optimize content for each platform to best serve them. Understanding how each platform prioritizes content is crucial to an effective strategy. Work smarter, not harder. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To help you understand what each social media platform aims to do and get a handle on their respective algorithms, we give you the real estate social media algorithm guide. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facebook<\/span><\/h2>\n<h4><b>Algorithm prioritizes<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Meaningful, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">active<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> interactions.<br \/>\n<\/span><b>Why<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: They want the time people spend on Facebook to be quality time, so they are prioritizing posts from friends and family, and content that sparks conversations. <\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cHere together,\u201d is Facebook\u2019s latest mantra. The platform has officially set out to foster and prioritize meaningful interactions specifically among <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">friends and family<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, rather than business pages. This means less public content will show up in user\u2019s news feeds. This also means that, if Facebook is your primary channel for social media marketing, you\u2019ve likely noticed a difference in your organic reach and engagements. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As scary as the Facebook algorithm change sounds for the businesses that use it as a platform to network, promote their business and listings, the changes are inherently simple. Before posting, ask yourself the following questions: <\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Will this post educate, inform, inspire, or entertain people? <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Will this post start a conversation? <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Will this post be shared by others? <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your answer to the first question wasn\u2019t a resounding, \u201cYES,\u201d reconsider posting it. All algorithms aside, if your content isn\u2019t serving any of the above purposes, you might want to rethink your marketing strategy entirely.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Bottom line: 80 percent of content you share share on Facebook should educate, inspire, or entertain people; the other 20 percent can market your business.<\/p>\n<p>You can still use Facebook as a means to market your business, but if it&#8217;s reach you want, you might have to pay to play by boosting posts or running ads.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instagram<\/span><\/h2>\n<h4><b>Algorithm prioritizes<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Timely, engaging posts from relevant users.<br \/>\n<\/span><b>Why<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Instagram wants to show its users the best, relevant content to the most people. <\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although owned by Facebook, Instagram\u2019s algorithm prioritizes content differently than that of its parent company. Where the Facebook algorithm aims to foster meaningful interactions, Instagram\u2018s mission is to put relevant, engaging content in front of people in a timely fashion. You may remember a few years ago when Instagram introduced its algorithm, changing users\u2019 feeds from a chronological experience to what it deemed relevant and engaging.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Factors that influence Instagram\u2019s algorithm: <\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Engagement<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; likes, comments, shares, video views, AND how quickly users engage with a post<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Time spent consuming <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; this applies to photos, as well as videos. If a user clicks the caption to read more, Instagram views this as increased consumption.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Frequent Consumption<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; regular saves, likes, comments, and shares from users will prioritize your content in their feed. <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Timeliness<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; read, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recency<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Relevancy <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; content genres exist!

We\u2019re talking memes, animals (#catsofinstagram), sports highlights, or inspo (interior decorating, fashion, inspirational quotes, etc.).<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Always know your target audience so you can optimize your content, taking the above factors into consideration. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LinkedIn<\/span><\/h2>\n<h4><b>Algorithm prioritizes:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Engagement and connection strength.<br \/>\n<\/span><b>Why: <\/b>To show users news, timely and popular content valuable to other professionals, and job posts. LinkedIn is clear about one thing: being a professional platform.<\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before investing too much time trying to grow a consumer-facing business on a platform designed for professionals, consider whether LinkedIn is <\/span><a href=\"\/blog\/is-linkedin-worth-your-time\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">right for you<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LinkedIn\u2019s algorithm is unique in that content can potentially go through <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">four <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rounds of content review. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assuming a piece of content or post makes it through LinkedIn\u2019s initial SPAM filter, it will publish to the feed temporarily to measure quality and engagement. \u00a0If your content signals that it\u2019s both quality and engaging, it will continue on to the next stage of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/engineering.linkedin.com\/blog\/2018\/03\/a-look-behind-the-ai-that-powers-linkedins-feed--sifting-through\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LinkedIn\u2019s AI-powered algorithm<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. However, if your post is flagged or hidden from any user\u2019s timeline, LinkedIn will consider that negative feedback and the half-life of your post could stop there. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The third stage in LinkedIn\u2019s algorithm checks for virality, assessing the quality of the poster and their network. This is to ensure both the poster and their network are not suspicious. In addition to vetting the credibility of the poster, the algorithm will also determine relevance and usefulness of the post to others. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fourth and final stage a post will pass through on LinkedIn before getting a full-fledged green light is\u2026 wait for it\u2026 a human filter. In this stage, LinkedIn uses real people to review content and determine whether a post is valuable to others. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Factors that influence LinkedIn\u2019s algorithm: <\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Engagement <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; likes, comments, shares, and how quickly users engage with a post. <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Connection Strength <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; if users frequently engage with your posts, they\u2019re more likely to see them. <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Hashtags<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; LinkedIn is now promoting the use of hashtags so if you tag your post properly, and your page isn\u2019t private, your post can be found publicly for anyone interested in those topics!<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Professional &#8211; <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">avoid political, religious, or overly personal commentary. <\/span><\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twitter<\/span><\/h2>\n<h4><b>Algorithm prioritizes<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Tweets ranked by time and relevance to a user, using a scoring system.<br \/>\n<\/span><b>Why<\/b>: Twitter wants to show its users the most relevant and time-sensitive content.<\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twitter\u2019s algorithm takes three main factors into consideration when determine what a user sees on their timeline: <\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Tweet &#8211; consumption, engagement, type of media (image, gif, video), and recency.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Tweetor &#8211; strength of connection the user has with the author, past interactions, when the connection was made.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The User &#8211; types of Tweets they\u2019re likely to engage with, how often they use Twitter<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twitter\u2019s primary goal is to serve Tweets to users who are likely to enjoy its content, engage with it, and strengthen engaging relationships. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In spring of 2018, Twitter <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/official\/en_us\/topics\/product\/2018\/Serving_Healthy_Conversation.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">announced<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a new approach to serving healthy conversations and reduce abuse, harassment, and \u201ctrolling\u201d behaviors by identifying users who are likely to \u2018distort and detract\u2019 from public conversation.

It uses keywords to serve up relevant visuals for its users. Pinterest is used to plan and research ideas (think DIY remodel ideas, housewarming parties, interior decorating). Pair that with the fact that 40 percent of Pinterest users have a household income of over $100,000 and you can start to see why Pinterest is often underrated. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Okay, back to Pinterest\u2019s algorithm. When you create a Pin, it\u2019s shared with your followers first. If it performs well, your Pin will be distributed to people outside of your network who might be interested in it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You might be noticing a trend among social platforms that prioritizes content algorithms find engaging, recent, and relevant but where PInterest differs from the others is SEO.
