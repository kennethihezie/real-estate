For some, like <a href=\"https:\/\/showcaserealty.net\/\">Nancy Braun<\/a>, Showcase Realty Charlotte\u2019s broker\/owner, real estate may be a third or even fourth career.<\/p>\n<p>Braun was born in New York and attended Cornell University, where she received a degree in industrial and labor relations. She went on to SUNY Buffalo Law School from there and, upon graduation, entered the world of corporate law.<\/p>\n<p>Act II finds Braun leaving that world behind and opening a restaurant in Buffalo. For five years, this chef\/owner thrived in the culinary world. As so many stories go, however, when the economy tanked, so did Braun\u2019s restaurant.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI survived, but I didn\u2019t make a living,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI didn\u2019t see any future in it. It was a question of moving my restaurant or moving me, so I moved me,\u201d she concluded. \u201cI really don\u2019t like the cold anyway,\u201d she added, laughing.<\/p>\n<h2>To Charlotte<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>So where does one go to escape the frigid winters in Buffalo, N.Y.? About 650 miles south would do the trick, according to Braun.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t really know much about Charlotte, but I heard it had a good economy, nice weather, nice people and that it would be open to newcomers. It lived up to all those dreams,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>With the new location chosen, all that was needed was a career focus. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do,\u201d she explained. \u201cI applied to law jobs, and I was looking for a restaurant.\u201d Her dad stepped in, however, and encouraged her to get into real estate.<\/p>\n<h2>Challenges<\/h2>\n<p>We all have challenges at different points in our careers, and we wondered what Braun\u2019s are at the almost-20-year mark.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy biggest challenge is changing up how we do business &#8211; implementing change &#8211; and getting a different mindset for the staff and the agents,\u201d Braun said. \u201cThe world is changing, so implementing new systems and programs &#8211; new ways of generating new business &#8211; and getting people to understand that the old school doesn\u2019t really work today with the Internet world and the fast pace. Just adapting to change is probably my biggest challenge.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As owner\/broker of her own real estate firm, Braun has her hands full. She has 50 people depending on her, including staff, agents and independent contractors. Obtaining leads for her agents takes up a large chunk of time, as does hitting the pavement every day as an active sales agent.<\/p>\n<h2>Marketing<\/h2>\n<p>Braun uses a mix of marketing methods to get the word out about Showcase Realty, its agents and listings. \u201cWe have a weekly radio show on a major news channel. We do a lot of postcard mailings, and we have very good Internet exposure \u2013 a strong social media presence and blogs,\u201d she explained.<\/p>\n<p>The firm also uses an SEO coach. \u201cShe helps us with our SEO development and some of our Internet marketing initiatives,\u201d Braun said. It was this coach that insisted the company go with a Market Leader site.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe have over 5,000 leads in our Market Leader system and they\u2019re all assigned to a drip system,\u201d Braun said. \u201cIt works well. I like that you can individualize them. You can have a basic drip campaign and then you can implement your own stuff within that campaign. It\u2019s also easy-to-use for the consumer.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>She gives her agents and staff a lot of credit for coming up with interesting marketing ideas. \u201cI have a strong staff of very creative people, so that\u2019s kind of fun. It\u2019s a young and dynamic team of people, and I kind of give them a lot of freedom so they can grow and implement really cool marketing strategies.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Where\u2019s Nancy?<\/h2>\n<p>When she isn\u2019t working you can find Braun with her two children, ages 8 and 9. \u201cWe had a big bake sale yesterday and we raised $104 for dogs and cats that are homeless,\u201d she explained when we asked what sort of things the family enjoys doing. \u201cIt was my son\u2019s idea and it was really special. I had to get up early in the morning and bake. Then we sat outside in our neighborhood and sold our baked goods and beverages, and it was really fun,\u201d Braun continued.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI like the fact that he did it for charity \u2013 that was the whole point. He wanted to do it for dogs and cats. He first came up with the idea of making money for animals and then he said, \u2018Mommy, you\u2019re going to do a bake sale,\u2019\u201d she said, laughing.<\/p>\n<h2>Giving Back<\/h2>\n<p>As much as Braun loves the real estate business and enjoys running her own brokerage, it was when we asked her about her community work that she got excited. The Boys and Girls Club of Greater Charlotte has a huge fan in Nancy Braun.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m the chairperson of resource development, which means I\u2019m in charge of all their fundraisers,\u201d she explains. \u201cThey really save children\u2019s lives; it\u2019s not just a Band-Aid,\u201d she continues. \u201cSixty percent of the kids in Boys and Girls Clubs say that it has saved their lives. It provides them with mentoring and love and support, and a place to go after school when they might not have anywhere else to go,\u201d she continues.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey have people that care about them. It makes a big difference to be cared about.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Real estate agents typically don\u2019t start their working lives in the industry, but rather hail from a broad array of businesses.
