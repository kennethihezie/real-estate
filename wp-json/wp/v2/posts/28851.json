The format and rules for the event were simple: share your advice, lean in, participate in conversations, no sales pitches or presentations, all thoughts and opinions are welcome, and utilize the \u201ctwo-feet rule,\u201d which means get up and walk out of the session if it doesn\u2019t met your expectations or needs. And lastly, a reminder that this is an \u201cunconference\u201d \u2013 participants are to share and mastermind with attendees and walk home with actionable ideas.<\/p>\n<p>Since it was my first time attending and the first time Market Leader was an event sponsor at a unconference of this nature, I was on the edge of my seat with excitement. Upon check-in, I wrote down a few topics on index cards that I wanted to learn more about and felt I could contribute to. But I didn\u2019t know until the final agenda was posted which ones would make the list.<\/p>\n<p>Once the agenda with room assignments was posted (see image to right), I realized I was in for a treat since many of my favorites made the list. Here are the big \u201ca-has\u201d that I walked home with from this event:<\/p>\n<h2>#1: Develop a Strategic Social Media Plan<\/h2>\n<p>You can\u2019t reach an end goal unless you know where you currently stand. Same goes with growing your real estate practice. You must first develop a strategic plan that includes outlining and defining the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Plan Goal(s)\/Objective(s)<\/strong> \u2013 your business goals.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Strategies<\/strong> \u2013 Outline the steps you\u2019ll take to achieve your goals.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Success Metrics<\/strong> \u2013 How will you measure your goals?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Conduct a SWOT analysis of your current social media efforts<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013 Outline strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats and\/or benchmarks of other companies in your niche.

Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.\u201d Same goes with generating leads in real estate, you could fish on your own, but you\u2019ll be more successful having the right tools in your tackle box.<\/p>\n<p>One must learn how to attract and find online buyers and sellers and which tools to use to \u201chook\u201d them as quickly as possible. As discussed at REBC, the secrets to catching or engaging an online lead include building <strong>TRUST<\/strong>, being <strong>RESPONSIVE<\/strong> preferably, being the first to respond to a lead within the first five minutes, and engaging your leads with listing alerts and campaigns using your business <strong>CORE VALUES<\/strong> in your marketing pieces, messaging, team culture and sales approach to attract your ideal target audience. You also want to be sure your bait is good \u2013 providing fresh, relevant <strong>CONTENT<\/strong> that pertains to your <strong>AUDIENCE<\/strong> will keep them coming back.

Marketing messages via storytelling is trending these days. Why? Consumers are more likely to purchase based on an emotional response. Four reasons consumers most likely don\u2019t buy from you: no trust, no need, no money, or no urgency. Stories evoke emotion and build trust. Test different mediums to showcase your authentic self \u2013 use video to share a welcome message, write a blog that shares your insights and knowledge, use an e-newsletter to stay in touch with customers. Make it engaging and human. After all, you\u2019re working with people.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #993300;\"><em>\u201cPeople don&#8217;t buy what you do; they buy why you do it. And what you do simply proves what you believe.\u201d \u2015 Simon Sinek, author of \u201cStart with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action\u201d<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<h2>#4: It\u2019s Not About YOU<\/h2>\n<p>Don\u2019t post an image of one of your current listings on your Facebook business page and expect your sphere of influence to like and share it. Instead, share stories, client testimonials or a link to a current real estate listing marketing video. The video can show how you hired a professional videographer, a drone, and professional actors \u2013 demonstrating your occupation as a Realtor\u00ae, your brand niche, your expertise and a taste of your passion.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #993300;\"><em>Tip: To WIN you\u2019ve got to first GIVE.

The key to your success in growing fans and followers is to determine how to spin the same content for each platform that connects with your audience and initiates a conversation. Someone at\u00a0<em>REBarCamp<\/em> described this well:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong> Facebook<\/strong> is for posting news about a family barbecue party, not for posting all the homes you sold last week or hope to sell next month.<\/li>\n<li><strong> LinkedIn<\/strong> is for posting your resume, researching companies and networking, not for sharing your daughter\u2019s dance recital photo.<\/li>\n<li><strong> Google Plus<\/strong> is for building relationships, sharing knowledge, and building SEO.<\/li>\n<li><strong> Pinterest<\/strong> is for building brand identity with the use of photos and images.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>#6: Be Consistent<\/h2>\n<p>It sounds rudimentary, but the key to any social media strategy is being consistent. Create an editorial calendar and action plan, and keep your content consistent. Start with just one channel and build upon that while staying true to the messaging you defined in your plan.<\/p>\n<p><em>Have you attended a REBarCamp lately?
