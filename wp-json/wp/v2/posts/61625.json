But to nail it like an expert agent and consistently get a response from your leads, there are many techniques you have to follow every time you leave a message.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">Prepare Like a Pro<\/h3>\n<ul class=\"BlogUL\">\n<li class=\"BlogLI\">Do your research. Calling a new or old lead can feel nerve-racking, but even just a little bit of preparation is all it takes to provide the confidence you need to succeed. Make sure you have all of the relevant details about your lead close at hand so you can be ready to bring your best, whether they pick up or not.<\/li>\n<li class=\"BlogLI\">Get ready. The best way to avoid sputtering a scattered, rambling message is simply to stop and center yourself. Pause for a moment to ensure you\u2019re in the right headspace to leave an outstanding message that\u2019s bursting with significance. And do what you need to do to feel energized so that you can convey enthusiasm.<\/li>\n<li class=\"BlogLI\">Clear your throat and prepare your voice so you don\u2019t ruin a good script by performing it with that raspy, I-just-woke-up sound. How? Rattle off some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.voices.com\/blog\/vocal_warm_ups\/\">tricky tongue twisters<\/a> or run through some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.scienceofpeople.com\/vocal-warm-ups\/\">vocal warmups.<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">Leave an Unignorable Voicemail<\/h3>\n<ul class=\"BlogUL\">\n<li class=\"BlogLI\"><em>Always<\/em> leave a voicemail. Why? Two main reasons. First, your prospect or lead needs to connect you with your number so they can call you back or know it\u2019s you when you try again. Most of us ignore calls from numbers we don\u2019t know. And second, reaching the inbox presents a golden opportunity for you to introduce yourself and establish your brand and personality. Every point of contact\u2014even one as small as a voicemail message\u2014is a chance to plant a seed that one day may result in a commission check.<\/li>\n<li class=\"BlogLI\">Follow a script. The goal isn\u2019t to sound like a robot. A well-structured script is actually meant to do the opposite\u2014it\u2019s meant to help you sound like <em>you<\/em>. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to adapt your scripts to match your brand voice. Memorize them. Record yourself or ask a friend to help you practice to ensure you sound natural while working through the script.<\/li>\n<li class=\"BlogLI\">Be relational, not salesy. No one wants to feel like they\u2019re being used to boost your bottom line. So be friendly and provide value. Demonstrate that you actually care about them as a person.<\/li>\n<li class=\"BlogLI\">Sound confident, not desperate. This too is a turn-off for many prospects. Establish trust immediately and make sure they feel like you\u2019re the service-oriented expert who can provide what they need.<\/li>\n<li class=\"BlogLI\">Express enthusiasm. (Without overdoing it.) Your prospect will often reciprocate your tone. So avoid speaking with a monotone, drab, and lifeless voice. If you\u2019re cheerful, excited, and energetic, they\u2019ll feel that and respond likewise. That alone is attractive. Make it easy for them to get excited <em>with<\/em> you.<\/li>\n<li class=\"BlogLI\">Speak slowly and clearly. Articulation is important. A muddled message is a useless message, and words spoken too quickly get lost. This is where nerves can really mess things up. So breathe. Slow down. And make your points shine with crystal clarity. What\u2019s the right pace? According to research conducted by <a href=\"https:\/\/virtualspeech.com\/blog\/average-speaking-rate-words-per-minute\">VirtualSpeech<\/a>, a widely-recognized speech training organization, conversational speech falls between 120 to 150 words per minute. Have you ever tested yourself to see if you\u2019re leaving a voicemail at an appropriately-conversational pace?
