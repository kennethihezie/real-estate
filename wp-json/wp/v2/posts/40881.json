How Real Estate Agents Can Get Vacation Time"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>When was the last time you took some time off? Since most real estate agents rarely take vacation time, you probably can\u2019t remember.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re feeling chained to your client list and think it\u2019s impossible for you to take a vacation, think again. The world\u2014and your business\u2014won\u2019t fall apart if you take some time for yourself. Your mind and body will, however, if you don\u2019t.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">Why Real Estate Agents Need Vacation Time<\/h2>\n<p>If you earn in excess of $100,000, you <a href=\"\/blog\/a-portrait-of-the-agent-realtor-habit-survey\/\">probably<\/a> work more hours than your colleagues who make less money. In fact, around 40 percent of agents in that income bracket work more than 50 hours a week, according to an Inman study. And the hours increase with income: More than 50 percent of agents that earn $200,000 or more work more than 50 hours a week.<\/p>\n<p>That amount of time spent working means stress, fewer hours spent with family and no time to yourself\u2014potentially a recipe for disaster. \u201cThe impact that taking a vacation has on one&#8217;s mental health is profound,\u201d clinical psychologist Francine Lederer <a href=\"http:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Technology\/vacations-2011-time-off-improves-productivity-reducing-stress\/story?id=14293331\">tells ABC News<\/a>. &#8220;Most people have better life perspective and are more motivated to achieve their goals after a vacation, even if it is a 24-hour time-out.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>If that doesn\u2019t convince you that you need time off periodically, consider the famous <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2008\/06\/07\/business\/yourmoney\/07shortcuts.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;\">Framingham Heart Study<\/a>. The results found that women who seldom vacationed\u2014every six years or less\u2014were eight times more likely to have a heart attack or to develop heart disease than those who took at least two vacations each year.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt shows how the body reacts to a lifestyle of stress. This is real evidence that vacations are important to your physical health,\u201d Elaine Eaker, a co-author of the study, told the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2008\/06\/07\/business\/yourmoney\/07shortcuts.html?pagewanted=all\">New York Times<\/a>. Another study cited by the Times showed that men who didn\u2019t take a vacation every year were 32 percent more likely to die from a heart attack than those who did take an annual getaway.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, it\u2019s scary to think of leaving your clients and your business behind. But leave you must, for both your mental and physical health. Here are some ideas for how you can do it.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">Take on a Partner<\/h2>\n<p>If you are so busy that you wouldn\u2019t dream of taking vacation time for fear that your real estate business would fall apart, maybe it\u2019s time to take on a partner. Yes, you\u2019ll be splitting your commissions, but with two sets of commissions coming in, you may not even feel a pinch.<\/p>\n<p>A partner can take over the business while you take some time off. \u201cYou can take vacations\u2014real vacations\u2014ones where you do NO work,\u201d author, speaker and real estate trainer Kelle Sparta <a href=\"http:\/\/activerain.com\/blogsview\/950580\/working-with-a-partner---the-team-approach-to-real-estate\">says on ActiveRain<\/a>. \u201cIt means, in short, a higher quality of life.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Trainer and author Jennifer Allan-Hagedorn says that \u201cOne of the toughest things about being self-employed is finding someone reliable to watch your business so that you can get away\u2026 vacation coverage is a prime benefit to having a partner.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s blissful actually, especially if you\u2019ve been selling real estate a long time. Your first vacation when you truly don\u2019t have to worry about business? You\u2019ll wonder why you didn\u2019t get a partner before,\u201d Hagedorn concludes.<\/p>\n<p>Alas, partnerships aren\u2019t for everyone. If that includes you, read on.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">Hire Someone<\/h2>\n<p>When you expand your solo practice to a team, you aren\u2019t really \u201chiring\u201d other agents any more than your broker hired you. They remain independent contractors. Most solo agents hire a buyer\u2019s agent first. That agent is perfectly capable of handling your clients while you\u2019re out of town to enjoy some time off.<\/p>\n<p>If you insist on remaining solo, at least think about taking on an assistant. A licensed assistant can perform most of the duties that will be required in your absence. A <a href=\"\/blog\/real-estate-virtual-assistant\/\">virtual assistant<\/a> or <a href=\"\/blog\/real-estate-interns\/\">intern<\/a> can help lighten your workload with administrative tasks.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">Borrow Someone<\/h2>\n<p>If you don\u2019t want to partner up and you can\u2019t stand the thought of hiring anyone, but you need some time off, hand over your current business to a fellow agent in your office. You\u2019ll have to be willing to split your commission, of course, but if you agree with the psychologists and studies mentioned about the importance of taking time off, it will be worth it.<\/p>\n<p>If push comes to shove, take just one day off to start. Explore your local area, hike, bike, go to a movie or get reacquainted with your family. Make sure you unplug the phone and keep the laptop closed. This is no-work time, no matter what.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When was the last time you took some time off?
