IDX stands for Internet Data Exchange and is how the MLS shares listing data among its members. Since it is all about sharing listings, IDX is also sometimes known as \u201cBroker Reciprocity.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>IDX enables all active listings in the MLS to be shared between MLS members and displayed on the websites of MLS participants (agents and brokers). IDX was created to make sure all MLS members have equal information to all MLS listings. Each MLS has policies in place for their IDX feed designed to make sure no one user has any unfair advantage and that all listings are available to the participants.<\/p>\n<p>While the IDX feeds are designed to give all MLS members equal access to listings information, not all IDX websites are created equal. The website functionality of an IDX feed can make all the difference between having a website that generates business and one that doesn\u2019t.<\/p>\n<h2>What is Your Site For?<\/h2>\n<p>The vast majority of agents say the main purpose of their website is generating leads. If this is your goal, effective lead generation campaigns rely on content that gives your target audience what they want. The purpose of a real estate agent\u2019s website should be to appeal to potential homebuyers and sellers in order to generate leads.<\/p>\n<p>So what are homebuyers and sellers looking for online?<\/p>\n<p>Homebuyers simply want to look at listings. Potential sellers also often want to look at listings to check out the competition for their home. And, since many sellers are buyers too, they may be looking for a new home to buy. That\u2019s what an IDX feed on your website is for &#8211; to give these searchers what they are looking for: listings.<\/p>\n<h2>What do Effective IDX Websites Have?<\/h2>\n<p>An IDX website is a must for lead generation, but to get those leads you will need features that will make your IDX website into a business generator.
