It started with the listing portals \u2013 Zillow, Trulia and the others.<\/p>\n<p>In the beginning, they were primarily lead generators (and lead sellers) and they stayed away from actual transactions.<\/p>\n<p>Then, OpenDoor launched in 2014 and the industry began changing. This company and its imitators began \u201cmoving closer to the transaction \u2026 getting involved in more parts of\u201d it, Michael DelPrete claims in an Inman Select <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=l2OmyguHNQE&amp;feature=youtu.be\">video<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>With Instant Offers, he says, Zillow began \u201cmoving from search engine to service engine.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Today, there are several others in the iBuyer space, all clamoring for the holy grail of real estate: listings.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>What is an iBuyer?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>iBuyers are quite similar to the cash-heavy real estate investors who make rock bottom offers on homes, fix them up and flip them. Apparently, iBuyers bristle at being called \u201cflippers,\u201d but that\u2019s pretty much what they are.<\/p>\n<p>But, that\u2019s an opinion and, like all opinions, there\u2019s an opposing side. Some, like the brilliant Notorious R.O.B, beg to differ.<\/p>\n<p>\u201ciBuyer is Not Real Estate Investing; Real Estate Investing is Not iBuyer,\u201d he <a href=\"https:\/\/notorious-rob.com\/2018\/11\/the-case-for-ibuyer-becoming-the-default\/\">says<\/a> and for proof of his point he quotes (wait for it) <em>Spencer Rascoff<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Rascoff\u2019s argument, by the way, is that \u201cFlipping requires distressed homes and distressed sellers, people that are selling their home under duress, and it only applies to a very small segment of the market.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Those who utilize the services of iBuyer companies, on the other hand, favor \u201cspeed, certainty, ease, convenience,\u201d Rascoff continues.<\/p>\n<p>Who is he trying to kid?<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe motivated Seller who wants to sell fast, is willing to sell low, and does not want to work with an agent is the one the Investor wants,\u201d says an investor at BiggerPockets.com. She describes the very <em>same<\/em> consumer that iBuyers target.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>So, buying homes at less-than-market value, fixing them up and then reselling them is called \u201cflipping,\u201d but <em>not<\/em> when Zillow does it.<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In fact, all of the companies in this space stress (repeatedly) that their home sale process is \u201cconvenient and hassle-free.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The bottom line for the consumer, however, is that iBuyers use automated value models (AVMs) and we all know how unreliable those are. Then, there are plenty of horror stories from home sellers about the pitiably small offers they\u2019ve received.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAn agent in Atlanta requested offers on his own newly renovated home with OpenDoor, Knock, and OfferPad to see how the process worked,\u201d explains an unnamed writer at MetroBrokers.com.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cHis property, which was appraised at $495,000, received [iBuyer] offers from $265,000 on the low end to $373,000 on the high end.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It\u2019s easy to read that and assume that iBuyers are going nowhere, fast. And, nationally, they only capture 0.2 percent of the market (2018, all U.S. iBuyers), according to DelPrete.<\/p>\n<p>But he also goes on to remind us that all real estate is local: \u201cIn November of 2018, in Phoenix, the market share of all iBuyers was 5 percent.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Zillow\u2019s Instant Offer generated 20,000 Phoenix listing leads in its first four months in the market. That\u2019s 20,000 homeowners in one city who actually clicked through and requested an offer from Zillow, DelPrete explains.<\/p>\n<p>Impressive, right?<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Is there any good news for agents in all this?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s get back to those 20,000 leads that Zillow generated. DelPrete says that the company purchased only one percent of the homes.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike agents, however, Zillow doesn\u2019t <a href=\"\/blog\/the-biggest-mistakes-agents-make-with-leads\/\">throw away leads<\/a> that don\u2019t or can\u2019t immediately transact. In fact, they\u2019ll be selling 99 percent of those 20,000 leads to you guys.<\/p>\n<p>These are leads who were motivated enough to ask Zillow for an evaluation of their home\u2019s value for possible participation in the Instant Offer program. So, motivation is the bonus.<\/p>\n<p>The downside to these leads is that they\u2019ll most likely haggle over your commission and they may be unrealistic about their price (thus why Zillow didn\u2019t work with them).<\/p>\n<h2><strong>How can agents compete?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>This is one of those question that stumps the industry. Many agents feel that they don\u2019t need to compete.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBecause the one thing startups can\u2019t disrupt is the real estate agent,\u201d according to Henry Grabar, staff writer for <a href=\"https:\/\/slate.com\/technology\/2018\/06\/redfin-zillow-and-opendoor-cant-disrupt-real-estate-agents-and-may-not-want-to.html\">Slate.com\u2019s Moneybox<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Perhaps making just a few changes, if performed en masse, is the answer.<\/p>\n<p>Presenting your services in a more positive light will go a long way in combatting the lure of convenience and the \u201chassle-free\u201d process that iBuyers promote.<\/p>\n<p>Sure, selling a home is somewhat of a hassle. Remind potential listing clients that with the right agent, it can be a smooth process and bring in top dollar for the home.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>In short, watch your words.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>I recently read a real estate blog post that began with an entire paragraph about just how much of a hassle selling a home can be.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSelling your house can be one of the most stressful events of your life,\u201d it begins. Then, there\u2019s the attempt to scare the you-know-what out of the seller by reminding him or her that the home will be open to \u201ctotal strangers.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The negativity doesn\u2019t stop there, though. The third sentence reminds the seller that \u201cyou\u2019re facing the daunting task of moving in the (hopefully near) future, and you\u2019re worried about the finances of selling your home.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Not content with reminding the reader that moving is a \u201cdaunting task,\u201d the writer also felt the need to slip in a hint that the home <em>may<\/em> not sell in the near future.<\/p>\n<p>Finishing up this completely stupefying paragraph is the reminder that \u201cuncertainty\u201d underlies the entire home sale process: \u201cwill you find a good buyer in time, will you get a fair value for your home, and will the sale of your home go smoothly?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I don\u2019t know about you, but after reading this, I\u2019d sincerely consider going with an iBuyer.<\/p>\n<p>I get it. If you explain just how complex the home sale process is, sellers will be less likely to go FSBO.<\/p>\n<p>But FSBO isn\u2019t their only option in 2019. While some agents are sounding like Debbie Downer in their marketing copy, the iBuyer folks are all sunshine and unicorns in explaining how easy-breezy their process is.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Use iBuyers&#8217; ignorance to your benefit.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>You, as a boot on the ground, have the experience of working directly with real estate consumers. Perhaps decades of this experience. You know what they want and what they don\u2019t want.<\/p>\n<p>Those at the top of the iBuyer chain do not. In fact, at least in Zillow\u2019s case, they\u2019ve vastly misunderstood the typical home seller. Jeremy Wacksman, Zillow\u2019s chief marketing officer, claims to know exactly what home sellers want.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat they care about is pushing the button and making magic happen,\u201d he claims.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMagic, in this case, means selling your house in a matter of days, even at a small discount,\u201d Grabar adds.<\/p>\n<p>Can anyone be more out of touch with the average real estate consumer? Yes, home sellers would LOVE to have a \u201cmagic button.\u201d Their idea of \u201cmagic,\u201d however, is selling the house in a matter of days FOR FULL MARKET VALUE.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How many sellers have you dealt with who were willing to take one cent less than what their home is worth just to have it sell quicker? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s agree that from here forward, your marketing to home sellers will be more positive about the process. Remember:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your method of determining their home\u2019s value is far superior to an AVM.<\/li>\n<li>Even Spencer Rascoff\u2019s home value wasn\u2019t nailed by Zillow\u2019s AVM.<\/li>\n<li>Since iBuyer fees are higher than real estate commissions (at least for now), home sellers working with an agent will not only make more money from the sale but have professional representation as well.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Personally? We don\u2019t think you have anything to worry about.<\/p>\n<p>The lazy agent, the complacent agent and the one who is in it just for the money?<\/p>\n<p>They should worry.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>After decades of coasting along relatively comfortably, the real estate industry is facing an onslaught of disruptors.
