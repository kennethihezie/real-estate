It\u2019s easy to see why some real estate agents are weary of finding a coach (hint: If they refer to themselves as a guru, you may want to run). \u00a0Despite all the charlatans, it\u2019s worth investigating whether a coach can help you meet your goals before you chalk them up to being snake oil salesmen.<\/p>\n<h2>What Real Estate Coaches Offer<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-8191\" title=\"real estate coach\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/11\/Fotolia_40675936_XS-198x300.jpg\" alt=\"real estate coach\" width=\"198\" height=\"300\" \/>Just like a baseball, football or basketball coach, a real estate coach helps you come up with a game plan. According to Dave Harding, Chief Research Officer for iHave5Questions, real estate coaches offer four main advantages:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Helping you set short-term goals to achieve long-term goals you set for yourself.<\/li>\n<li>Adding to your skills.<\/li>\n<li>Keeping you motivated (to use all your skills, including the ones added by the coach).<\/li>\n<li>Holding you accountable and on track, using 2 and 3 to accomplish 1.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>A good real estate coach excels at keeping you focused on your goals, coming up with workable strategies and having a way of measuring success.\u00a0According to Bobby Casey, the Managing Director of Global Wealth Protection, \u201cA coach is typically someone who has been through the process you are currently facing and has come through the battlefield victorious. They can help guide you and avoid some pitfalls you may otherwise miss.\u00a0If nothing else this person can shoot down your stupid ideas when you think they are world changing.\u201d They may not make you go to the gym, but they\u2019ll help you build a strong company.<\/p>\n<h2>Who Needs Coaching?<\/h2>\n<p>If you are an active real estate agent, you need a coach. Surprised? Even veteran real estate agents employ coaches. The best time to get a coach is at the very start of your career. According to Dave Harding, \u201cAs a new practitioner, soak in all the coaching available from your brokerage for the first year, or first\u00a0calendar\u00a0year, whichever horizon you will use to benchmark yourself. <\/p>\n<p>Thereafter, you should be supplementing what you get from your broker with you-specific coaching. Accept anything provided by your broker (or franchise parent company, or professional association) but do not rely on that generic support to determine your personal success.\u00a0Then measure the coach\u2019s contribution. If it\u2019s not working, do what your clients do:\u00a0Find another professional, but don\u2019t give up on the idea.\u00a0\u201c<\/p>\n<p>A real estate coach does more than just brainstorm with you about ways to improve your business. In fact, most people don\u2019t suffer from lack of ideas. Most people suffer from disorganization, demotivation and the inability to measure results. For instance, how do you know that your <a href=\"\/blog\/real-estate-newsletter-marketing-tips\/\">newsletter marketing strategy<\/a> is working? Can you measure how many people saw your Sunday advertisement in the paper? A real estate coach can help you keep track of what is working and how it can be improved.<\/p>\n<h2>Finding a Coach<\/h2>\n<p>You most likely already know your coach. \u201cSometimes you can get a job working for someone whom you respect and admire.\u00a0In many cases this leads to a mentor relationship where you can develop that relationship throughout your career. You may also seek out professionals that are successful in your chosen field and offer them something of value in exchange for time granted for educating and working with you in real estate investments.\u00a0In my experience, this is almost never a financial transaction, but one of exchanging value for value.\u00a0Maybe you are good at building websites or marketing, so you may offer those services to your targeted coach or mentor in exchange,\u201d says Bobby Case.<\/p>\n<p>No one is an expert in every field. You may need more than one coach. It\u2019s common in business for someone to have various experts they turn to for advice. Perhaps you need a coach for marketing and another one to help you with preparing contracts.\u00a0A good place to start looking is in your network. Ask other real estate agents if they can recommend a coach. The desire for a real estate coach shows that you are willing to take your business to the next level. A coach can help you every step of the way and cheer for you on the sidelines.<\/p>\n<p><em>Have you used a real estate coach?
