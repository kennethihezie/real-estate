As Dr. Phil says, how\u2019s that working for you?<\/p>\n<p>You caution your sellers about the importance of curb appeal. You counsel them to clean up and maybe even stage the home\u2019s interior. Then you come along, snap some quick photos on your smartphone and slap them on the MLS.<\/p>\n<p><strong>While curb appeal is your client\u2019s responsibility, web appeal is yours.<\/strong> You have one chance to impress \u2013 a scant two seconds to grab a buyer\u2019s attention without a photograph and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/SB10001424127887324077704578360750949646798\">20 seconds with one<\/a>. Do iPhone listing photos or those you take with a point-and-shoot camera make optimum use of those valuable seconds?<\/p>\n<h2>Why High-Quality Listing Photos Matter<\/h2>\n<p>When the typical buyer looks at an online listing, the first thing she does is look at the photo, according to Michael Seiler, founder and director of the Institute for Behavioral and Experimental Real Estate at Old Dominion University at Norfolk, Va.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe find that the photo is overwhelmingly viewed first,\u201d concludes Seiler\u2019s study, \u201cToward an Understanding of Real Estate Homebuyer\u00a0Internet Search Behavior: An Application of Ocular Tracking Technology.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&#8212;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 16px;\"><strong>Photos are overwhelmingly viewed first in real estate listings.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&#8212;<\/p>\n<p>Agents that just can\u2019t find the time to photograph their listings \u2013 an alarmingly common occurrence \u2013 and rely on a pithy description instead, may reconsider that behavior in light of the fact that most Internet home shoppers won\u2019t even look at listings without photos. Even when a listing includes photos, 40 percent of all participants donn\u2019t even look at the agent remarks section.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px;\">What professional listing photos look like:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-20991\" title=\"beautiful listing photo\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/beautiful-listing-photo.jpg\" alt=\"A beautiful listing photo taken by a professional real estate photographer\" width=\"600\" height=\"362\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px;\">What iPhone listing photos look like:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-21051\" title=\"bad real estate listing photo\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/bad-real-estate-listing-photo.png\" alt=\"Awful listing photo taken by a clueless real estate agent\" width=\"510\" height=\"294\" \/><\/p>\n<p><em>Images courtesy of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/24763767@N03\/3847734160\/\">Ben Freedman<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/hookedonhouses.net\/\">HookedOnHouses.net<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>What Professional Listing Photographers Brings to the Table<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">According to a 2010 Redfin study, homes that are professionally photographed sell for at least $934 and as much as $18,819 more than homes photographed by an amateur. The study also shows that <strong>homes photographed by a professional garner 61 percent more online views.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><\/strong>&#8212;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 16px;\"><strong>Professionally-photographed homes sell for up to $19,000 more.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&#8212;<\/p>\n<p>The key to getting these results is in creating inspiration, according to real estate photographer <a href=\"https:\/\/onsitestudios.com\/\">Jay Groccia<\/a>. Effective marketing photos are inspirational. If homebuyers perusing the Internet get inspired by a photo, \u201cthey\u2019ll click through to the agent&#8217;s website. If they don&#8217;t, they click \u201cback\u201d to view the next result in the search list,\u201d Groccia explains.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThat was it &#8211; right there &#8211; that was your opportunity to grab that buyer\u2019s attention, and if they clicked back, you\u2019ve lost them forever,\u201d he cautions.<\/p>\n<h2>&#8220;But I Own a Really Good Camera &#8230; &#8220;<\/h2>\n<p>Many agents fancy themselves photographers merely because they bought a high-end camera and taught themselves how to use it. There is an art, however, to good photography. The skilled professional knows how to use composition, color and lighting to make a photo more appealing. <strong>Owning a great camera makes one no more a professional photographer than owning a Wolf range makes one a professional chef.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>To illustrate this further, real estate photographer <a href=\"https:\/\/johnbeckerphoto.com\/\">John Becker<\/a> tells a story about a blues fan who attended a B.B. King concert and was able to meet him in person after the show.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBackstage, he thanked Mr. King and said, \u2018I&#8217;ve always admired that particular guitar &#8211; it sounds so good!\u2019 Mr. King&#8217;s response was to take the guitar off his shoulder, lay it on a table, and ask, &#8216;How does it sound now?'&#8221;<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>\n<a href=\"\/products\/professional-for-agents\/\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-44201\" src=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Blog-CTA-arrows-2.png\" alt=\"Learn more about the Market Leader Professional IDX-enabled websites with beautiful listing photos\"><\/a><strong><em>Market Leader Professional\u2019s agent branded websites feature MLS listings with beautiful listing photos and are designed to collect leads and capture visitors&#8217; search criteria. <\/em><a href=\"\/products\/professional-for-agents\/\">LEARN MORE &gt;&gt;<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2>How Much Do Professional Listing Photographers Cost?<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright  wp-image-21011\" title=\"Professional real estate photographer\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/professional-real-estate-photographer-243x300.jpg\" alt=\"Professional real estate photographers aren't cheap but they offer a significant return on investment\" width=\"219\" height=\"270\" \/>In an online real estate forum, the question of whether to use a professional photographer for listing photos was met mainly with the lament that photographers \u201ccost too much.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Although we can\u2019t find a study on the average fees that a real estate photographer charges, we do know that they vary across the country, with photographers in New York being the priciest.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&#8212;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 18px;\"><strong>Hiring a professional listing photographer costs 0.09% of the median U.S. home price.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&#8212;<\/p>\n<p>Photographers who hang out at Digital Photography Review claim that $300 to photograph the whole house &#8211; interior and exterior &#8211; is the going rate. A photographer in Montana offers a menu of options in different price ranges according to the home\u2019s square footage. His prices start at $125 and top out at $300.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s assume that you\u2019re an average agent, working in an average market where the median sales price is the same as the national median, about $222,275, and you take one of those average listings.<\/p>\n<p><strong>If you spend just 1\/10 of 1 percent of the list price to advertise the home, it would cost you $222.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Considering your commission will be $6,668 and change, $222 seems paltry, doesn\u2019t it? Kick down just a bit more and you can hire a professional photographer.<\/p>\n<p>The extra money spent to adequately market your listing pays off even after the sale. An additional benefit of drop-dead gorgeous photos is that you\u2019ll be viewed as more professional and get more listings, hopefully with a higher price tag.<\/p>\n<h2>Be the Agent &#8211; Not the Photographer<\/h2>\n<p>Deep down inside agents understand that they can\u2019t wear all the hats in their real estate practice and still adequately serve their clients \u2013 especially while simultaneously trying to grow their businesses. It\u2019s the agents who delegate that typically move to the next level.<\/p>\n<p>Even if you fancy yourself a budding photographer and have all the high-end equipment necessary, <strong>your time is better spent drumming up new listings and growing your business.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&#8212;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 18px;\"><strong>Real estate agents are hired to sell homes, not take photos.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&#8212;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I used to believe that a good product sold itself,&#8221; admitted Phil Knight, co-founder and chairman of Nike, Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Lots of real estate agents fall into the same trap. <strong>A good house will not sell itself without your assistance.<\/strong> Even in the best of markets, advertising your listings is essential.
