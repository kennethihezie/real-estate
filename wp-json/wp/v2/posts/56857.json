Your real estate business plan will act as your road map. It will let you know where you are right now and where you want to go (and how to get there) in 2019. Without it, you may just end up \u201csomeplace else.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2><strong>The basics of a real estate business plan<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>First, consider two myths about business plans:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>They are fixed.\u00a0<\/strong>Many experts recommend that you revise and adjust the plan as the year goes along.<\/li>\n<li><strong>They are based on facts.\u00a0<\/strong>They\u2019re not; they are mostly based on assumptions gathered from your past performance.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>There are a lot of different styles of business plans and many are real estate-specific. Then, there are variations among agents when it comes to determining\u00a0 priorities, budget and more.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The basics, however, include<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Goals<\/li>\n<li>Strategies<\/li>\n<li>Tactics<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Before refining these basics, you\u2019ll need to create a budget.<\/p>\n<h2>Your budget<\/h2>\n<p>Step number one in the construction of any business plan is the budget. After all, you need to know where you stand financially if you hope to come up with a plan for how you\u2019ll spend your marketing, tech and other dollars in 2019.<\/p>\n<p>If you had a plan for this year, use it to help you build next year\u2019s. If you lack a previous business plan, you\u2019ll need to create your budget from scratch and you can find a lot of help for that online. In fact, we show you how in our <a href=\"\/blog\/your-2019-real-estate-business-plan\/\">2019 Real Estate Business Plan<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Find other blueprints and walk-throughs to help you create a budget at:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.inman.com\/2018\/04\/09\/how-to-set-a-budget-for-your-real-estate-business\/\">Inman.com<\/a> \u2013 We love this walk-through of the basics from Dani Vanderboegh.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.freshbooks.com\/blog\/the-5-step-plan-to-creating-a-balanced-business-budget\">Freshbooks.com<\/a> \u2013 Offers a 5-step budget-creation plan.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/business-guide\/plan-your-business\/write-your-business-plan\">sba.gov<\/a> \u2013 Good advice here from the Small Business Administration<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5>By the way, not only is your business plan not static, your budget isn\u2019t either.<\/h5>\n<p>Financial experts agree that you should revisit your budget at least monthly. As your pipeline changes, so will your finances. Good on you if that pipeline is full of spot-on real estate leads. But, you may be falling short of your projections and the sooner you know that, the better.<\/p>\n<p>New agents \u2013 don\u2019t forget to budget for the tools you\u2019ll need to purchase. These include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>CRM (Customer Relationship Management) \u2013 <a href=\"\/blog\/why-relationship-management-crm-is-crucial-in-real-estate-5-ways-to-maximize-roi\/\">Learn how to choose the right CRM<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Website\/Blog \u2013 It\u2019s not enough to have a spot on your broker\u2019s website, you need your own, with your own branding. Make sure it\u2019s optimized for mobile, that you have local IDX and that your site integrates with your CRM.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Setting business goals for 2019<\/h2>\n<p>Use your budget to help determine your financial goal for the new year. How much do you want and need to make? That\u2019s the magic number from which your strategies and tactics will flow.<\/p>\n<p>This is where it gets somewhat complicated, and the point at which many real estate agents give up on their business plans. To determine how you will reach that financial goal you\u2019ll need to know:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>How many listings\/sales it will take to reach that number.<\/li>\n<li>Your conversion rate so that you can figure out how many leads you need to generate each month to get those listings and sales.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For new agents, your conversion rate is the number of clients you gain divided by the number of leads you generated each month, multiplied by 100.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>For a quick, personalized breakdown of sales and leads you&#8217;ll need to hit your goals, check out our <span style=\"color: #00ccff;\"><a style=\"color: #00ccff;\" href=\"\/leadcalculator\/\">Lead Calculator<\/a>.<\/span><\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Your conversion rate will no doubt differ from other agents, but it\u2019s an important number.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>The strategies required to get you there<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Your 2019 business plan shouldn\u2019t be a copy of 2018\u2019s.
