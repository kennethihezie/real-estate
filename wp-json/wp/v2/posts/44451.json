At the beginning of each show, an agent takes the buyers to a chosen neighborhood, and as they walk the streets, asks them to guess the price of each home for sale.<\/p>\n<p>Yup, you guessed it: Most of the time, the buyers undervalue the homes. You probably see something similar in your own real estate practice.<\/p>\n<p>So, what can you do to bring a sense of reality to buyers\u2019 wish lists? While \u201cshock therapy\u201d works \u2013 by showing them exactly what they <em>can<\/em> afford in a chosen neighborhood \u2013 sometimes it\u2019s better to approach the situation with more subtlety.<\/p>\n<h2>Be Honest About the Market<\/h2>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a great time to buy!\u201d say way too many real estate agents. Even in the run-up to the housing market collapse, when prices were inflated, some agents were sending newsletters and publishing blog posts about what a fabulous time it was to buy a home.<\/p>\n<p>This is where agents need to get real. It isn\u2019t always a great time to buy \u2013 especially for first timers. When investors are heavily involved in a market, it\u2019s a horrible time for the average first-time buyer. Ditto for when inventories are tight.<\/p>\n<p>If you hope to keep your client\u2019s expectations in the realm of reality, it\u2019s important for you to be honest about the current market. If it\u2019s a tough market for them, let them know \u2013 and advise them on ways to handle it.<\/p>\n<h2>Teach Buyers About Seller Psychology<\/h2>\n<p>\u201cInsult a seller and kiss that dream home goodbye,\u201d \u2013 these should be words of warning that agents are happy to dispense to their clients. Sadly, they aren\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p>Lowball offers or excessive requests for concessions and repairs to the wrong seller will kill a deal. When you counsel your clients, bring them up to speed on what kind of market they\u2019re entering and whether you believe low offers will be accepted or denied. Make sure their price expectations are grounded in reality.<\/p>\n<p>Explain to them how some sellers can be emotionally attached to their homes and to improvements they\u2019ve made. Coming in ridiculously lower than the list price may be taken as an insult, and no counter will be forthcoming.<\/p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t to say there\u2019s never a time to lowball, but you need to counsel your client on when it\u2019s appropriate and when it\u2019s insulting.<\/p>\n<h2>Help Buyers Work Within Their Budgets<\/h2>\n<p>On another real estate show, the clients are two 25-year-olds on a budget of $250,000, who insist on looking for a home in an area full of million-dollar houses. \u201cMy ideal house would have double staircases \u2026 a Spanish-style house with columns around the front door,\u201d says the man. She wants an \u201cold-style\u201d house with an updated kitchen and large closets. Oh, and an attached garage. And at least two bathrooms. And a backyard. All this, in an area where condos are priced over $300,000.<\/p>\n<p>These weren\u2019t just dreams or wishes. This couple was telling their agent exactly what they wanted in a home. And they expected to get all of it for $250,000 or less.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not just upscale amenities that some first-time buyers expect. \u201cA survey by Coldwell Banker Real Estate of 300 first-time buyers found that a startling 87 percent said that \u2018finding a move-in ready home is important\u2019 to them,\u201d according to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/wp-dyn\/content\/article\/2011\/03\/03\/AR2011030306660.html\">Washington Post<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, they don\u2019t want to paint, rip out carpet or buy new appliances. In fact, as you well know, many buyers can\u2019t see beyond ugly wall colors and will even dismiss a home based entirely on the paint. First-time buyers, especially, can\u2019t seem to grasp the difference between their dream home and a starter home.<\/p>\n<p>When buyers expect to have granite countertops and stately columns at the front door, and these items are foreign to homes within their budget, it\u2019s time for the aforementioned \u201cshock therapy.\u201d Show them homes that are priced at or below their price point, so that they have absolutely no doubt they\u2019ve been living in a fantasyland.<\/p>\n<p>One Northern Californian agent tackles clients that expect every entry-level home to be turn-key by keeping a folder of before and after photos in her car. \u201cOne of my clients bought this house,\u201d she\u2019ll tell them while showing a photo of a living room with purple walls. \u201cHe spent less than $200 on paint and look at that room now,\u201d she says as she shows the after-photo.<\/p>\n<p>There are other creative ways to help buyers overcome unrealistic expectations.
