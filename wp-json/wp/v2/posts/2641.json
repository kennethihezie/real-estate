Sjodin, founder of Sjodin Communications, asks, <em>&#8220;What if you were able to craft a knock-it-out-of-the-park message, deliver it in three minutes or less, arouse the interest of a decision-making listener, and open up a new world of possibilities? Wouldn\u2019t you do it?\u201d<\/em> 1<\/p>\n<p>The most successful real estate agents have a short pitch (often called an \u201celevator pitch\u201d) that is rehearsed, yet conversational; factual, yet easily digestible; and well-timed, but not pushy. Think of it as another way to expand your real estate marketing to attract more potential leads.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #7a003c;\">Consider these helpful tips for creating the perfect pitch:<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Be passionate about your business.<\/strong> Enthusiasm is contagious. Demonstrate that you are passionate about the real estate industry, your clients, and your career, and listeners will feel your authenticity.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Use vocabulary that is easy to understand.<\/strong> Don\u2019t spend these valuable seconds using industry buzzwords and jargon. Craft a message that is approachable, easy to understand, and unintimidating to the general public.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Keep it short.<\/strong> It\u2019s called an elevator pitch for a reason\u2014you\u2019re supposed to be able to get through the whole pitch while traveling up or down just a couple of floors on an elevator. Make sure your pitch only as long as it needs to be to get your main point across. People have short attention spans, are easily distracted, and want to cut through the fluff.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Create a real estate agent tagline.<\/strong> Get to the core of your message with a simple, key phrase that sums up why home buyers and sellers should work with you. Your real estate agent tagline will help you market yourself and establish your personal brand.<\/p>\n<p>Terri L. Sjodin suggests, <em>&#8220;Don\u2019t just think of an elevator speech as a generic tool you use in chance moments\u2014consider the concept as a strategy to manage multiple talking points and to communicate more complex ideas as well.\u201d<\/em> 1<\/p>\n<p>In the competitive industry, a well-developed 30-second pitch can be a powerful networking and lead generation tool to supplement your real estate marketing efforts.<\/p>\n<p><em>1 Sjodin, Terri L.
