They are your neighbors, your cousins, your brothers and sisters. Chances are good that a real estate agent sold you your house or manages your apartment complex. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, at any given time, there are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bls.gov\/ooh\/sales\/real-estate-brokers-and-sales-agents.htm\">422,000 real estate agents living among us<\/a>. Their kids go to school with your kids. They may be sitting next to you at a football game. A few of them are even able to keep up the appearance of normalcy.<\/p>\n<p>Scientists aren\u2019t sure where real estate agents come from, though most are easy to spot. They send signals to each other by wearing small tokens of real estate agentism called \u201cnametags\u201d on their coats. These tokens not only communicate to potential clients what to call them, but with other signifiers, such as distinctively-colored overcoats, may indicate tribal affiliation and status \u2013 much in the same way a silverback indicates the status of a gorilla.<\/p>\n<p>Some agents do not operate openly, however. Instead, they maintain \u201cday jobs\u201d during the week while sneaking off to \u201cnetworking functions\u201d at night, under the cover of darkness, and to \u201copen houses\u201d on the weekends, where they engage in elaborate rituals in an effort to find clients, listings and other like-minded people.<\/p>\n<h2>10 Signs Your Spouse Is an Agent<\/h2>\n<p>Could you be married to a real estate agent?
