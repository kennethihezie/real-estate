Conventional listings, tours, and open houses are trending digital to cater to millennials and Gen Z buyers. Younger, tech-savvy generations are conducting up to 90 percent of their research online before you\u2019ve even made contact with them.

They want their properties marketed alongside the best of the best. Virtual tours have become on way to engage prospects viewing your listings and website. Thankfully, as technology advances and becomes more accessible, prices come to be more affordable (averaging about $300.00 for a 3,000 square foot home).<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hgtv.com\/design\/real-estate\/how-to-stage-your-home-with-the-click-of-a-mouse\">Virtual staging<\/a> is another increasingly popular technology to lure potential buyers by turning empty spaces into furnished, perfectly staged rooms that better helps buyers visualize themselves in a space. Change wall colors, flooring, even upgrade finishes to help shoppers visualize a home\u2019s potential. Virtual staging tends to cost much less than traditional staging, too, averaging between two and four hundred dollars. Be sure to disclose any properties that have been staged virtually, however, to avoid any unmet expectations in person.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Take advantage of analytics.<\/strong><br \/>\nWhile analytics are less of a financial investment, they\u2019re vital to tracking and managing your successes. <a href=\"https:\/\/analytics.google.com\/\">Google analytics<\/a> are free and offer valuable insights on every page of your website, the ability to drill down your pages and content to identify what performs best, and track your digital advertisements.<\/p>\n<p>If you have business pages on Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter, each platform offers in-house analytics and insights to track your pages\u2019 activities and performance. LinkedIn offers post analytics for individual pages, and in-depth insights for followers, visitors, and updates. Many analytics resources are available and free to use, so be sure to explore the tools you\u2019re already using and the insights they offer. Remember: if it can\u2019t be measured, it can\u2019t be improved or repeated.<\/p>\n<p>One big trend cultivating as we approach 2018 is predictive analytics.
