One phone call and the sign is installed to our specifications. Another one and it\u2019s taken down and stored. Most agents never touch their signs unless it\u2019s to re-attach a wind-blown rider.<\/p>\n<p>Like most aspects of the real estate industry, real estate yard signage is changing.<\/p>\n<h2>History of Real Estate Signage<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-8901\" title=\"real estate yard signs\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/Fotolia_32750180_XS-267x300.jpg\" alt=\"real estate yard signs\" width=\"267\" height=\"300\" \/>Historically, real estate signs served two purposes: They advertised a piece of property for sale and provided contact information to interested buyers.<\/p>\n<p>With the formation of real estate brokerages, real estate signs added another dimension: the opportunity to distinguish one company from another. It worked, too. Brokerages such as Century 21, Re\/Max and Coldwell Banker created signs that remained the same for decades, firmly branding their logo into the minds of consumers.<\/p>\n<p>This all started to shift about a decade ago, according to Monte Pratt of <a href=\"https:\/\/jackpratt.com\/\">Jack Pratt Signs<\/a>. \u201cAgents no longer wanted to wrap their identity into the broker\u2019s identity,\u201d he recalls.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBack in 2002 we noticed that Keller Williams agents didn\u2019t want the standard red and gray signs, they wanted to build their own signs \u2013 to break free of the corporate brand,\u201d Pratt continues. \u201cGary Keller realized that prospective real estate clients choose an agent, not a brokerage, and decided that, with certain standards and guidelines put forward, agents should be allowed to brand their signs in whatever unique ways they choose.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This is when Pratt\u2019s company seized the opportunity and began creating custom signs for agents. You can find photos of some of these signs at Pratt\u2019s ActiveRain <a href=\"https:\/\/activerain.com\/blogs\/montepratt\/\">profile<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Real Estate Signs Today<\/h2>\n<p>Fifty-three percent of today\u2019s homebuyers list \u201cyard signs\u201d as the method they use to find a home, according to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nar.realtor\/news-releases\/2012\/10\/nar-survey-of-home-buyers-and-sellers-shows-dual-income-couples-fueling-market\">National Association of Realtors\u00ae<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>So, while signs remain valuable as a way to grab people\u2019s attention, today\u2019s agents are expecting their yard signs to multi-task.<\/p>\n<p>Some agents use QR codes on their signs, according to Pratt. The way most agents use QR codes, however, renders them ineffective as a lead capture system, and are nothing more than \u201cvirtual flyer boxes,\u201d according to Pratt.<\/p>\n<h2>Brochure Boxes and Riders<\/h2>\n<p>Are brochure boxes a thing of the past? From the neighbors complaining about flyers cluttering up the neighborhood, and neighborhood kids pilfering them, to the seemingly never-ending job of keeping the boxes full, many agents stopped using the boxes on their signs when QR codes began to get popular. Most of the agents we spoke with say that, unless their client specifically requests a box, they don\u2019t use them.<\/p>\n<p>The lowly real estate sign rider, however, is figuring prominently in agent branding efforts. Canadian agent Jake Palmer, in fact, has a fan club of sorts \u2013 folks who drive by his listings on a regular basis to find out what wacky rider he decided to use that week. Some of his most popular include \u201cNot Haunted,\u201d \u201cIndoor Plumbing\u201d and \u201cLove Shack, Baby.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Back when the housing market began to nosedive and price reductions were becoming the norm, Knoxville, Tenn. broker Bill McSpadden\u2019s \u201cReduced\u201d sign rider showed not only the industry\u2019s frustration, but served as a warning to low-ballers. In smaller print, below the word Reduced, it said \u201cbut not stupid or desperate.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Riders are also great gadgets on which to advertise your website url or the property\u2019s website. Social media riders, especially those that contain the agent\u2019s Facebook address, are popular right now, according to Pratt.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re thinking of modifying your marketing campaign in 2013 and need a method that is inexpensive and effective, consider changing the way you use your real estate signage. If you\u2019ve made the switch and are using your signs in innovative ways, we\u2019d love to learn more.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When one considers how much business we get from that thing sticking in the front lawn of our listings, it\u2019s amazing how we take them for granted.
