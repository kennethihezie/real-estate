The most basic email signatures should look like this:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Mary Baker<br \/>\nBroker, Acme Realty<br \/>\nE: mary@acmerealty.com<br \/>\nP: 425-XXX-XXXX<br \/>\nF: 425-XXX-XXXX<br \/>\nW: http:\/\/www.acmerealty.com<br \/>\nB: http:\/\/blog.acmerealty.com<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>With this signature, Mary has given five different ways to reach her \u2013 via phone, email, fax and online.<\/p>\n<p>The signature above is basic but helpful. It tells people who Mary is, and how to contact her, but doesn\u2019t describe much about what she does. It also doesn\u2019t give people a reason to immediately engage with her, to explore more, or to request more information that will learn more quickly to a transaction.<\/p>\n<p>For example, what if underneath the contact information she added this:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Sign up for our FREE newsletter!<br \/>\nhttp:\/\/newsletter.acmerealty.com<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Everybody should have a link in their email signature to their newsletter sign-up page. If you\u2019ve already signed up with Constant Contact, that page is free and already built for you!<\/p>\n<p>With these basic calls to action, Mary has given his email recipients something to interact with right away, something further to explore, and immediately given them an opportunity to engage with my company and come closer to a transaction.<\/p>\n<p>Think about what these links could look like for you. Some examples include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>For real estate agents, offer a free CMA or access to home listings<\/li>\n<li>Offer a free copy of one of your special reports (from your freebies list)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>But whatever you decide to include in your email signature, make sure it works harder for you, and gets people more engaged in learning about your services, your expertise, and getting much closer to a transaction with you.<\/p>\n<p><input id=\"gwProxy\" type=\"hidden\" \/> <input id=\"jsProxy\" onclick=\"jsCall();\" type=\"hidden\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Even the most basic email services offer a \u201csignature\u201d tool, which basically auto-populates the bottom of your email with whatever you like.
