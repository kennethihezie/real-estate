Now, consider an agent who has spent the bulk of her career dealing with REO (real estate owned) properties. When she decides to make the switch to traditional residential real estate sales, the differences are striking.<\/p>\n<p>Jasmine Blue, an agent with RNB Homes in Lincoln, Calif., is discovering this contrast as she winds up her first year in non-REO sales. \u201cThe biggest challenge for me is working with real people again,\u201d she disclosed.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI shifted from REO, which is very black and white, and you\u2019re working with banks and not dealing with people so much, to short sales, where I still worked with banks, to cracking the traditional sales nut,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt\u2019s quite challenging for me.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Blue grew up in the San Jose, Calif., area and moved to Lincoln as a teenager. \u201cCow Town,\u201d she described it, laughing. It\u2019s no longer really a cow town\u2014in fact, Lincoln was described by the U.S. Census Bureau as the fastest growing city\u00a0in the state back in 2011.<\/p>\n<h2>Pre-Real Estate Enterprise<\/h2>\n<p>Blue was a cook in a retirement community, and kicked around in the jewelry business for a time, before fate stepped in and steered her into the real estate industry.<\/p>\n<p>One of her co-workers at the jewelry store was dating a member of a top-producing real estate team in the area. \u201cI happened to pick up the phone one day and got to know him and he said \u2018Do you want to get into real estate?\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cI said \u2018Sure, where do I sign up?\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Blue started as an admin with an REO agent, where she was \u201cdoing property management, turning on utilities, kicking out tenants\u2014all the fun stuff,\u201d she said. That was seven years ago, when she was just 19 years old. Today, she has more than 2,000 distressed sales under her belt, and she and her partner oversee a team of seven.<\/p>\n<h2>Building Blocks for Success<\/h2>\n<p>When it comes to ramping up her traditional real estate practice, Blue believes that consistency is the key to success. \u201cI think a lot of Realtors\u00ae look for that magic wand to make their business thrive, and it just comes down to being consistent and finishing your projects and sticking with something. What works best is what works for you,\u201d she advised.<\/p>\n<p>Blue primarily uses traditional marketing methods. \u201cI do the standard stuff when I get a listing,\u201d she said. \u201cI go door knocking. I do the just-listeds. I call my database.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>She also uses Craigslist. We asked her about any challenges she faces with <a href=\"\/blog\/navigating-the-new-rules-of-craigslist\/\">the recent changes made to the listing service<\/a>.\u00a0\u201cYou have to adapt to the Craigslist changes,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely gone down in quality, but it still works and it\u2019s a free tool to use.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Blue was introduced to Market Leader products when she was with Keller Williams, and she decided to continue using them after she left the company. Her Market Leader website is what actually helps bring in new clients, she said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt works really well for lead capture,\u201d she shared. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely impacted me in a positive way. It probably accounts for 25 to 30 percent of my business, on the buyers side.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>It\u2019s Not All About Work<\/h2>\n<p>Blue gives back to the community by volunteering with The Glass Slipper, an organization that works with girls who have experienced abuse. One feature of the organization is a mentorship program, and Blue uses her experience as a cook to help out as a mentor in the cooking program.<\/p>\n<p>When she isn\u2019t working or mentoring, Blue enjoys being outdoors, fishing and hiking. \u201cAlso, anything to do with wine, I\u2019m definitely there,\u201d she added.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, when we asked her where she sees herself a decade from now, she said she\u2019d like to open a winery. Will it include a caf\u00e9 with Jasmine Blue cuisine? She laughed, \u201cThat will be at the top of my list.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s easy to assume that all real estate agents\u2019 business models are pretty much the same.
