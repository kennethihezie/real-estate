Me either, and as nice as some of those IRS folks are, I have a feeling we shouldn\u2019t wait for such a phone call.<\/p>\n<p>Nope, it\u2019s completely up to your accountant to ensure you get every last deduction you\u2019re entitled to. But accountants can\u2019t pull the proof for these deductions out of thin air; that\u2019s your job. And that requires a diligent adherence to that task we all hate to do: record keeping.<\/p>\n<h2>The Importance of Documentation<\/h2>\n<p>Keeping accurate records is vital to your pocketbook, according to CPA <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gailrosencpa.com\/\">Gail Rosen<\/a>. \u201cIt\u2019s so important to recognize the power of a deduction and not to miss any,\u201d she warns.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI liken it to downloading an app to your phone,\u201d explains <a href=\"http:\/\/www.teamzumwalt.com\/\">Bill Zumwalt<\/a>, \u201cThe Tax Coach\u201d for real estate agents, out of Tulsa, Okla. \u201cWhen you download an app you get a long list of legalese called terms and conditions. Tax strategies, like the home office, are just like apps,\u201d he continues.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou find one that fits, you download it, and then you read the fine print &#8211; the terms and conditions,\u201d says Zumwalt.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&#8212;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 16px;\"><strong>When it comes to taxes, documentation is your friend.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&#8212;<\/p>\n<p>He goes on to explain that the IRS has terms and conditions for deductions &#8211; things you need to do and requirements to meet to make a particular tax strategy work. \u201cThe devil is in the detail,\u201d warns Zumwalt. <strong>\u201cIf you have documentation, it will be your friend.\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a look at what the pros say are some of the most common tax deductions that agents are entitled to, and suggestions on how to document them.<\/p>\n<h2>Deduct Auto Expenses<\/h2>\n<p>Since it feels like your days are spent cooped up in a tin can, auto expenses and the purchase of a new car seem to be the best place to start any discussion of tax deductions for real estate agents.<\/p>\n<h3>How Realtors can Deduct Car Expenses<\/h3>\n<p><strong><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright  wp-image-21161\" title=\"Realtor deduct car expenses\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/deduct-car-expenses-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Real estate agents constantly use their cars for their businesses, which means they can deduct auto expenses from their tax returns\" width=\"240\" height=\"160\" \/>\u201cFor real estate agents, mileage is a huge deduction,\u201d<\/strong> claims <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reedcocpa.com\/\">David Crumbaugh<\/a>, a CPA in central Texas. \u201cWhen I deal with real estate agents, that mileage normally becomes their biggest expense,\u201d he claims.<\/p>\n<p>To take the mileage deduction naturally requires that you keep track of your mileage. What happens if you forget or just get sloppy with your record keeping?<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHopefully you maintain an Outlook calendar or some sort of appointment tracking system,\u201d Crumbaugh says.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&#8212;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 16px;\"><strong>Easiest way to deduct auto expenses: Deduct using a standard mileage rate.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&#8212;<\/p>\n<p>If the thought of keeping track of not only all those miles but also how much you spend on oil changes, car washes, gas and repairs makes your eyes glaze over, consider using the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.irs.gov\/pub\/irs-drop\/rp-10-51.pdf\">standard mileage rate<\/a>: 55.5 cents per business mile driven in 2012 and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/tax-professionals\/standard-mileage-rates\">56.5 cents per mile in 2013<\/a>. With this method, you don\u2019t have to track your auto-related expenses, just your mileage. Rosen warns to go through both methods to determine which one will save you the most money.<\/p>\n<h3>Record Keeping Tips for Deducting Car Expenses<\/h3>\n<p>You don\u2019t have to keep track of your mileage for the entire year. A three-month log is all the IRS requires, according to Zumwalt.<\/p>\n<p>He also suggests that you \u201cmake it a point to get an oil change at the first of every year. If you do that, you have a third-party document that shows your mileage,\u201d he claims.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re considering a new car, is it better to lease or to buy?

For instance, if you run your real estate practice from your den, you can\u2019t also use that den as a family room, media room, or exercise room or the deduction will be disallowed.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the additional deductible expenses not mentioned above include a percentage of:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mortgage interest.<\/li>\n<li>Casualty losses.<\/li>\n<li>Property taxes.<\/li>\n<li>Repairs.<\/li>\n<li>Depreciation.<\/li>\n<li>Maintenance.<\/li>\n<li>Condo association fees.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Your accountant can help you determine the percentage of the expenses you can deduct, but for a rough estimate, divide the number of square feet of the home that you use for your real estate business by the total square footage of the home. Then apply this percentage to the total of each expense. If it sounds complicated, that\u2019s only because it is, and it\u2019s exactly why you should hire a professional to do your taxes.<\/p>\n<p>Lots of agents work from both the home office and their broker\u2019s office.
