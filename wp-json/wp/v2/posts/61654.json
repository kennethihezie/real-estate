But it\u2019s never impossible. Unless of course\u2026 you have a flawed plan. Or worse, no plan at all.<\/p>\n<p>You may have heard the often-quoted (and apparently anonymous) adage that goes something like this:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEvery system is perfectly designed to give you the results you\u2019re getting.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>We hear it often because it\u2019s true. So if you\u2019ve hit a point in your career where you&#8217;re only getting buyer leads, it may simply be a matter of refining your lead generation system and your plan for growth. We\u2019re about to do just that.<\/p>\n<p>To help you eliminate the guesswork involved in getting more listing leads, we\u2019ve boiled it all down to seven essential tactics:<\/p>\n<ol class=\"BlogOL\">\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol class=\"BlogOL\">\n<li class=\"BlogLI\">Build Your Brand<\/li>\n<li class=\"BlogLI\">Nail Your Marketing<\/li>\n<li class=\"BlogLI\">Work Your Network<\/li>\n<li class=\"BlogLI\">Warm Up to Cold Calling<\/li>\n<li class=\"BlogLI\">Attend Events &amp; Host Your Own<\/li>\n<li class=\"BlogLI\">Find Your New Friends<\/li>\n<li class=\"BlogLI\">Buy Real Estate Leads<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Let\u2019s start with the foundation.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">Build Your Brand<\/h2>\n<p>Put simply, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/blog\/real-estate-agents-need-a-brand\/\">your brand<\/a> is what other people think of you and your real estate business. You have many competitors in this field, and branding is your differentiator. Everything you do to attract clients should fit into a compelling and cohesive brand experience.<\/p>\n<p>Want to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/blog\/improve-your-branding-to-attract-better-clients\/\">improve your real estate branding<\/a> so you can generate more listing leads? Start by answering these three essential questions:<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">What Is Your Unique Value Proposition?<\/h3>\n<p>A unique value proposition (UVP) is a statement that informs prospective clients about what sets you apart from the other agents in your market. Think of it as an elevator pitch, but in writing. It\u2019s what shows you\u2019re not a dime-a-dozen agent.<\/p>\n<p>Your UVP should be concise. It should be punchy so that it\u2019s as memorable and clear as possible. Most UVPs are only a sentence or two in length.<\/p>\n<p>Use numbers whenever possible. Stats and figures give prospects something to hold on to. Plus, they go a long way in boosting perceived credibility.<\/p>\n<p>Does your value proposition speak directly to sellers? For example:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI have helped more clients sell their Seattle homes in the last five years than any other agent. My client\u2019s homes sell in an average of just 20 days, 25 percent faster than the average for my area.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">What is Your Mission Statement<\/h3>\n<p>Your mission statement takes your UVP and turns it into an action that\u2019s tied to a greater purpose. It explains what you do, who you serve, how you\u2019re different, and why you do what you do.<\/p>\n<p>A well-crafted mission statement serves two very important functions. First, it keeps you focused on your priorities, your overarching purpose, and the meaningfulness of your work. And second, it tells your prospects and clients exactly what they can expect when they work with you.<\/p>\n<p>A mission statement does not need to be comprehensive, overly specific and detailed, or even a complete sentence.<\/p>\n<p>To get the creative juices flowing, consider these two examples:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/news.remax.com\/our-mission-to-be-the-worldwide-real-estate-leader\/\">RE\/MAX:<\/a> \u201cTo be the worldwide real estate leader, achieving our goals by helping others achieve theirs. Everybody wins.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.atlassian.com\/company\">Atlassian:<\/a> \u201cFrom medicine and space travel, to disaster response and pizza deliveries, our products help teams all over the planet advance humanity through the power of software. Our mission is to help unleash the potential of every team.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">Who Is Your Target Market<\/h3>\n<p>You can\u2019t be everything to everyone. If you try, your brand will end up blending in instead of standing out. So take the time to identify a focused target audience.<\/p>\n<p>Try to be as specific as possible. To narrow down even farther, consider creating profiles (or \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/buyer-persona-research\">personas<\/a>\u201d) based on your top two or three ideal clients.<\/p>\n<p>Let data be your guide. For example, if you\u2019re interested in a particular neighborhood, get all of the information you can find about the demographics in that area. Learn about who follows you on social media. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/solutions\/customizable-websites\/\">Get a customizable website with MLS listings<\/a> which attracts buyers and sellers and \u2013 crucially \u2013 collects and analyzes data about visitors\u2019 activities.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">Nail Your Marketing<\/h2>\n<p>Now that you\u2019ve considered the essential brand identity questions for your business, you\u2019re ready to move on to the second step: adjusting your marketing strategy to attract more listing leads.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, you can buy <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/products\/real-estate-leads\/\">online real estate leads<\/a>. But you also need to incorporate that lead generation strategy into a solid marketing plan that includes tried-and-true best practices as well as the newest cutting-edge ideas.<\/p>\n<p>To provide the briefest of checklists, here are three marketing strategy must-haves.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">A Social Media Strategy Designed To Get More Listing Leads<\/h3>\n<p>Don\u2019t underestimate the power of having a strong digital presence through social media. It may be among the simplest and most effective ways to generate leads.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, if you\u2019re looking for more listing leads, be sure to post content that\u2019s especially relevant for potential sellers in your area. Provide useful tips, helpful advice, and insightful statistics that demonstrate credibility and trustworthiness. With each impression, you\u2019re increasing the likelihood that you\u2019ll be top-of-mind when they\u2019re ready to sell.<\/p>\n<p>If you haven\u2019t already, take 15 minutes to <a href=\"https:\/\/fitsmallbusiness.com\/real-estate-facebook-page\/\">create a Facebook page for your business<\/a> that\u2019s tailored specifically to accommodate potential home sellers. Always remember to keep your professional profiles public so they\u2019re discoverable by the networks of people you are connected to.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">Advertising Investment<\/h3>\n<p>First, define which advertising channels you\u2019ll use to promote your business. Then determine your budget for each channel. Sometimes it\u2019s easiest to decide what you can afford on a monthly basis at first, and as you identify what performs best, you can map out your annual budget.<\/p>\n<p>Ad placement is crucial. Rather than placing ads where all of the other listing agents are and hoping for the best, think specifically about the home sellers in your target market and where they spend their time \u2013 both online and in person. Do your research and allow the findings to help you determine the best place to advertise.<\/p>\n<p>Important: In addition to the monetary cost of advertising dollars, think of the time cost involved with setting up and managing your campaigns. Should you be the one creating your seller lead generation campaigns, or an advertising expert who will be more effective and efficient?<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">Marketing Automation Tools<\/h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/blog\/real-estate-marketing-automation\/\">best real estate marketing automation tools<\/a> do it all. With <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/products\/professional-for-agents\/\">Market Leader Professional<\/a>, for example, you get a customizable website, a fully-integrated CRM, and the ability to automate campaigns, newsletters, and content pieces like postcards, flyers, and video-enabled mobile-responsive emails which will help you stay top-of-mind with your contact database so they think of you when it\u2019s time to sell.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">Work Your Network<\/h2>\n<p>If marketing is primarily about trying to reach prospects \u201cout there,\u201d networking is primarily about connecting with the many listing leads you\u2019ll find \u201cright here\u201d in your social spheres. You\u2019ve built your brand. You\u2019ve developed a marketing strategy. And now it\u2019s time to work your network.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">Let Friends and Family Know You\u2019re a Real Estate Agent<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s simple. It\u2019s basic. And we mention it here because it\u2019s an essential part of every lead generation strategy. Personal connection often trumps any other kind of connection.<\/p>\n<p>And chances are, someone who is part of your family or friend group is currently thinking about selling their home. If not, they probably know someone who is. Make sure it\u2019s your name that\u2019s fresh on their mind.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">Tap Into to the Wider Social Circle<\/h3>\n<p>What organizations, teams, and communities are you a part of? What about friends of friends? Are you part of any groups on social media?<\/p>\n<p>Most people belong to a bunch of networks without even realizing it. Here are some examples:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Church groups<\/li>\n<li>Clubs, like Rotary, rec sports teams, and alumni organizations<\/li>\n<li>Online group like Nextdoor communities and neighborhood Facebook pages<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This wider social circle is full of high-quality prospects and excellent referral sources. All of whom are more likely to choose you over a stranger without a shared interest.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">Warm Up to Cold Calling<\/h2>\n<p>Some real estate agents dislike cold calling because it\u2019s frustrating. Others feel anxious just reading about it. The truth is, it\u2019s often both frustrating and frightening.<\/p>\n<p>Some argue that it\u2019s one of the most important ways to generate listing leads. Others argue that it\u2019s a waste of time. Again \u2013 both are true.<\/p>\n<p>Like it or not, cold calling is still an effective way to get more real estate seller leads. The key is to understand who to target and how to talk to them. Here are two groups to target as part of the fourth step in getting more listing leads.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">Call FSBOs\u2014\u201cFor Sale by Owner\u201d Real Estate Listings)<\/h3>\n<p>Even though they might be resistant to the idea at first, many DIY home sellers can be persuaded to work with you instead when they realize how much you can help.<\/p>\n<p>Find FSBO listings on sites like Craigslist, ForSaleByOwner.com, and Zillow. Then give them a call, using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/blog\/best-fsbo-scripts\/\">the best FSBO script you can find<\/a> to increase the persuasion factor.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">Call Expired Listings<\/h3>\n<p>A step-by-step guide for getting more listing leads would be incomplete if it didn\u2019t include a tip about expired listings. These would-be-sellers are often in a tough spot.<\/p>\n<p>They had hopes and dreams of selling but couldn\u2019t. And now they\u2019ve either given up or they\u2019re unsure about how to move forward. You can be the agent who sweeps in to restore their confidence. Be sure to use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/blog\/expired-listing-scripts\/\">the best expired listing scripts<\/a> for each situation.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">Attend Events &amp; Host Your Own<\/h2>\n<p>Top-performing listing agents are always connected to a wide network. They\u2019re always on the lookout for new ways to develop relationships.<\/p>\n<p>One of the best ways to do that is to attend in-person events and to host your own. Here are the top three ways to expand your reach so you can get more listing leads.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">Attend Networking Events<\/h3>\n<p>There are many different kinds of events that are meant to help you establish a stronger network. But if you want more seller clients, look for meetups, community events, and smaller conferences that will put you in contact specifically with sellers from your target market.<\/p>\n<p>Struggling to find any events that are a good fit for you? Host your own!<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">Host a Community Event<\/h3>\n<p>Rather than going to meet prospects, have them come to you. It can be related to real estate, but it doesn\u2019t have to be. Have fun and get creative with it.<\/p>\n<p>Host a party, charity dinner, concert, local business giveaway event\u2026 the options are endless. It could be small or large, simple or extravagant.<\/p>\n<p>As long as you\u2019re reaching out to potential home sellers in your area and getting a chance to mingle, you\u2019re on the right track.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">Host Open Houses<\/h3>\n<p>Another great way to attract home seller leads is to host open houses. Captivating ones, not boring ones.<\/p>\n<p>Think of them as another kind of networking opportunity or community event. Make it the kind of event which potential listing leads in your area would actually want to attend, then show them what they can expect if they work with you to sell their home.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">Find Your New Friends<\/h2>\n<p>You could be the kind of lone-wolf real estate agent who shoulders everything on their own. There may be advantages to that. But it also comes at a great cost.<\/p>\n<p>You need help from a circle of friends: go-to contractors, photographers, movers, video editors, and other professionals from real estate-related fields.<\/p>\n<p>Working without them can prevent you from forming strong connections with your clients, building new relationships, generating listing leads, and managing your day-to-day tasks. And that might mean you have to turn away business because you simply can\u2019t find enough hours in the day.<\/p>\n<p>But you don\u2019t have to go that route. Instead, consider forming a team around you of experts who can offer support where you need it most. Not only can they shoulder the weight by providing the expertise you need, but they can also expand your reach and multiply your marketing efforts. Here are two ways to find your new circle of friends.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">Partner With Contractors, Home Stagers, Photographers, and Videographers<\/h3>\n<p>The benefit of having a go-to network like this is twofold. It sets you up to provide help for your sellers when they need these kinds of services. And at the same time, it widens your network and increases the number of potential referral sources you have.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"BlogH3\">Start a Team of Listing Agents (Or Join One)<\/h3>\n<p>Real estate agents are choosing to team up with other agents now more than ever before. There are four main reasons.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>A team structure provides accountability.<\/strong> Members keep each other on track and motivate, celebrate, and encourage each other along the way. All of that goes far beyond the warm-and-fuzzies. It leads to greater levels of productivity.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Teams often have a larger and more reliable stream of leads.<\/strong> They can combine their lead generation, marketing efforts, and social networks to create a business that\u2019s greater than the sum of its parts.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Working as a team presents an opportunity for each agent to specialize and focus on what he or she does best.<\/strong> The best teams work as a complementary whole \u2013 where one agent is weak, the other is strong, and vice versa.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are now more tools than ever before<\/strong> that make it possible for teams to work together and crush their gross commission income goals. With <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/products\/pro-for-teams\/\">Market Leader\u2019s Pro for Teams<\/a>, for example, real estate teams can recruit and retain agents, increase productivity with top-notch marketing automation, and create a seamless brand experience. All with one platform.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2 class=\"BlogH2\">Buy Real Estate Leads<\/h2>\n<p>In real estate, even the best business plans have to account for elements of unpredictability. There are always going to be factors that are out of your control. But getting a steady stream of exclusive online listing leads doesn\u2019t have to be one of them.<\/p>\n<p>Market Leader offers two real estate leads products to help you grow your business. One flat monthly rate buys you a guaranteed number of exclusive buyer and seller leads in your desired areas every month.<\/p>\n<p>Ready to get started? <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/products\/real-estate-leads\/\">Check lead availability in your area.<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Generating more listing leads can be extremely difficult.
