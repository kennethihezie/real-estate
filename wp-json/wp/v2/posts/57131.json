It\u2019s a particularly curious practice in a business where practitioners say they crave a way to set themselves apart from others.<\/p>\n<p>Same pose.<\/p>\n<p>Same smile.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s contagious. One of them gets an idea and it spreads through the body like a flu,\u201d House of Cards\u2019 President Frank Underwood claims.<\/p>\n<p>If that\u2019s true, members of the Senate and real estate agents have a lot in common.<\/p>\n<p>With real estate agent business cards, you have just seven square inches to convey your message. If half of that is taken up by your photo, and your photo screams \u201cNothing unique to look at here!\u201d you\u2019re doing yourself no favors.<\/p>\n<p>So, how can you use that valuable space for all it\u2019s worth? We went to the experts to find out.<\/p>\n<h2>To headshot or not?<\/h2>\n<p>The arguments for using a photo on a real estate business card equal the number against. Southern California broker\/agent Mellissa Zavala is in both camps, feeling that some situations call for a card with her photo.<\/p>\n<p>She solves the dilemma by carrying two different cards, one with and one without her headshot. The former is used in \u201csituations where I want to people to remember more than just my name,\u201d Zavala claims.<\/p>\n<p>Other agents feel that the photo is important, but not so much that it should take up the more valuable \u201creal estate\u201d of the tiny business card. These agents put their photo on the back.<\/p>\n<p>Eric Bryn, attorney, adjunct professor at Loyola University, and Chicago broker points out that professionals in other industries don\u2019t plaster their business cards with their photos (they don\u2019t offer their clients gifts at the end of a business deal either, but that\u2019s fodder for another blog post).<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn the space where the headshot goes, why not add a core value statement?\u201d he asks. He goes on to explain an even bigger reason he\u2019s against the ubiquitous agent photo on business cards. \u201cA few years back we did a really cool test,\u201d he begins. \u201cWe printed 2000 post cards for a client. Same exact message on both. One had a picture of an agent on the card, the other did not.<\/p>\n<p>Both had a very clear and defined call to action &#8211; a phone number. Each had a different number so we could get accurate results,\u201d Bryn explains.<br \/>\nHe and his team sent 1,000 of each card to area addresses. The results are pretty astounding.<\/p>\n<p>They got zero response from the 1,000 cards sent out that contained the agent\u2019s photo and nearly 200 responses from the 1,000 cards that lacked a photo.<br \/>\nBryn goes on to explain that they\u2019ve done similar tests on other types of agent marketing, such as webpages, whole sites, business cards and more. In every test, he claims, the marketing piece without the agent\u2019s photo out-performs the one with the photo.<\/p>\n<p>They have never found, \u201ca situation where an image of an agent increases conversation. What we find is, it completely obliterates it.\u201d<br \/>\nAgents and brokers who do recommend using a photo on a business card stress that the photo should be recent and professionally shot.<\/p>\n<h2>Agent \u2013 Heal Thyself<\/h2>\n<p>When counselling your listing clients on how to ensure their homes make a brilliant first impression, you suggest that they clean and declutter, right? Then, as you walk out the door, you remind them to call you if they need anything, handing them a business card that is full of clutter.<br \/>\nFrom the string of letters behind your name to a fax number, a headshot and every conceivable way to contact you, the card looks a bit like an ugly home page on a website.<\/p>\n<p>Cleaning up the clutter on your business card may help yours avoid being among the 88 percent that are tossed into the trash within the first week of receiving them.<\/p>\n<h4>Give your logo the space you devoted to your headshot and then include:<\/h4>\n<h5 style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">\u2022 Name (personal and brokerage)<br \/>\n\u2022 Email address<br \/>\n\u2022 Phone number<br \/>\n\u2022 Website URL<br \/>\n\u2022 URL of the social media site you\u2019re most active on<\/h5>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Pay attention to aesthetics<\/h2>\n<p>Designing a business card is a lot like designing a website; some of the same aesthetics apply.<\/p>\n<h5 style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">\u2022 Font choice<br \/>\n\u2022 Color<br \/>\n\u2022 Lots of white space<\/h5>\n<p>In fact, experts recommend that you use your website branding concept on your business card.<\/p>\n<p>Card stock is something you\u2019ll need to think about as well. \u201cWhen I receive a business card, I create an opinion about the company as soon as the card touches my hand. Is it thin and flimsy? Is it thick cardstock?\u201d Chris Ake of Grand Apps asks the Forbes Agency Council.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cCheap business cards get printed on: 100 lb. gloss cover,\u201d suggests Andrew Shu, with MGX Copy, a San Diego print company. He goes on to say, however, that a card printed on this stock \u201cfeels perfectly fine, and it doesn\u2019t feel cheap.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Fourteen and 15-point card stocks, on the other hand, \u201cfeel very corporate and professional.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Has technology killed the business card?<\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4>All of the above depends, of course, on which camp you\u2019re in when it comes to business cards:<\/h4>\n<h5 style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">\u2022 They are a must for real estate agents \u2013 old-school has merit<br \/>\n\u2022 This is the 21st century \u2013 business cards are outdated<\/h5>\n<p>Personally, I can\u2019t recall the last time I received a business card. Even the agent who helped me buy my home two years ago didn\u2019t proffer one.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBusiness cards still hold a purpose, which is quickly exchanging information at events, conferences and other networking opportunities,\u201d Leila Lewis of Be Inspired PR tells Forbes.com.<\/p>\n<p>Mark Sims, founder of Foundation, a design and branding company, claims that it\u2019s the smartphone that has killed the business card,\u201c . . . we can swap and store contact information with one another with a simple tap of the phone,\u201d he says, which does away with the need for a business card. This \u201ctap,\u201d however, doesn\u2019t \u201ccarry forward your brand identity,\u201d he continues.<\/p>\n<p>If this is important to you, keep using business cards. And, unless you hope to mimic the Black Astrum card ($1,500 per card and, yes, those are real diamonds), business cards remain an economical way to broadcast your brand.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>OK, who is the wise guy (or gal) who first suggested that folding your arms for your real estate business card photo is cool?
