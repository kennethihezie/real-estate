How easy you are to work with, how experienced and knowledgeable you are and how you saved a particular transaction?<\/p>\n<p>You can, as many agents do, create a space on your website to list all of that. But most of these pieces come off as far too salesy and way too much like what every other agent in town says about themselves.<\/p>\n<p>And, it\u2019s not just real estate agent marketing that creates skepticism in consumers \u2013 today, any claims by any company that aren\u2019t backed up by consumer reviews are treated with suspicion.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>If you aren\u2019t collecting agent reviews \u2013 aka testimonials &#8212; from your clients, you should start<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>More than 85 percent of consumers check a local business\u2019 reviews online, according to the Local Consumer Review Survey 2018 from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brightlocal.com\/research\/local-consumer-review-survey\/\">BrightLocal.com<\/a> a firm that offers reputation management services, among others.<\/p>\n<p>And, 27 percent of these consumers looked for a business review online daily, the study claims.<\/p>\n<p>Sadly, more than half of those in the ideal real estate demographic (ages 35 to 54) are more likely to read reviews for restaurants and caf\u00e9s than real estate agents.<\/p>\n<p>But that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t check real estate agent reviews, because they do.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>It\u2019s \u201csocial proof\u201d and all agents need it<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>\u201c \u2026 we determine what is correct by finding out what other people think is correct,\u201d according to psychologist <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/006124189X\/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0\">Robert Cialdini<\/a>, who coined the phrase \u201csocial proof\u201d in his 2009 book, <em>Influence: Science and Practice.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a bit hard to admit that we\u2019re basically sheep, looking to others to find out what is correct, what is \u201cbest.\u201d But that\u2019s exactly what we do, especially when we\u2019re feeling uncertain.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cUncertainty is the fuel that activates and feeds the mechanisms of social proof. When faced with an unfamiliar situation, an unsure individual would feel the need to refer to other people for guidance,\u201d claims an unnamed writer at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.psychologynoteshq.com\/social-proof\/\">PsychologyNotesHQ.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In real estate, social proof offers proof of your credibility, removes that uncertainty (thereby instilling trust) and helps consumers get to know you.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>How to choose which testimonials to use in your marketing<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Believe it or not, not all reviews that seem \u201cgood\u201d are actually good for your marketing efforts. Thankfully, surveys and studies show us which ones to trash and which to use.<\/p>\n<h3>Regardless of how amazing a review is, don\u2019t use it if any of the following apply:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The review is older than three months. Consumers find these reviews irrelevant.<\/li>\n<li>Reviews that are unsigned or use initials. Zillow or Yelp usernames instead of real names destroys the value of a review. Consumers think they are \u201cfake.\u201d Ask your clients to use their first and last name when they leave a review.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>According to the Bright Local survey, consumers place the most value on the number of stars in a rating and then, in order of importance to them:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Quantity of reviews<\/li>\n<li>Recency<\/li>\n<li>Length\/detail<\/li>\n<li>Sentiment of the review<\/li>\n<li>Business response or non\/response<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>How to use your real estate agent reviews<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Naturally you should have a section of your website devoted to your testimonials, but don\u2019t stop there.<\/p>\n<p>Choose one line from one of your favorite reviews. Ensure it encapsulates exactly why a real estate consumer should choose you above all other agents in your market.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s tempting to choose the most flattering-to-your-ego testimonial, but don\u2019t do it. A <a href=\"https:\/\/magazine.realtor\/sales-and-marketing\/feature\/article\/2015\/03\/what-your-online-about-me-says-about-you\">REALTOR\u00ae Magazine survey<\/a> of real estate consumers finds that they are \u201cstrongly critical of agents who posted testimonials that appeared overly self-serving.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Instead, choose one that highlights your success in overcoming a typical real estate consumer pain point.<\/p>\n<p>A testimonial that mentioned how the agent sold the home \u201cin 19 days for asking price\u201d was particularly attractive to the panelists in the aforementioned survey.<\/p>\n<p>One panelist said that the days on market mention gave the testimonia credibility, \u201cconsidering many online agent reviews are less detailed and sound automated.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Consider this when choosing that one line from a testimonial. If you\u2019re having trouble choosing, ask a non-real estate related friend or family member to read your testimonials and pick out one sentence that would make them want to call you.<\/p>\n<p>Then, use that one-line quote above the fold on your website, in your email signature and wherever else you can plaster it.<\/p>\n<p>Real estate reviews allow consumers to get an idea of what you\u2019re like to work with, how well you negotiate, market and overall perform your job.<\/p>\n<p>They can also help boost your credibility and instill trust.<\/p>\n<p>Whether it\u2019s where to eat dinner on Friday night, which movie to watch or which real estate agent to choose, social proof, in the form of reviews, is one of the most powerful marketing tools around.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You know all that stuff you want potential clients to know about you?
