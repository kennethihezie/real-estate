And Amy Summers of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.auburnpropertyvalues.com\/\">Gold Country Realty<\/a> in Auburn, Calif. is one of those agents.<\/p>\n<p>I asked her to explain a little bit about her background.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI grew up in Northern California, in Oroville. It\u2019s a little country town near Chico,\u201d she began. \u201cI moved to Sacramento when I was 20 years old. Now I\u2019m back in the country again, in Auburn, where I\u2019m happy,\u201d Summers said.<\/p>\n<p>Before joining the real estate agent ranks, Summers worked in outside sales. \u201cI sold a bunch of different products &#8211; fabrics, wall-covering, rugs, wallpaper,\u201d she recalled.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI did that for about 10 years. Before that I owned a custom workroom where I made products for interior designers,\u201d she continued. \u201cI actually made their bedspreads and their pillows and their curtains and all that stuff.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>While she excelled at what she did, she wasn\u2019t fulfilled. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t very fun; it was very stressful,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>When the sales reps came in to show their fabrics she envied them. \u201cI\u2019d say, \u2018That looks like a fun job \u2013 how do I get to do that job?\u2019 They told me, and I did it. I closed my workroom and hit the road,\u201d Summers recalled.<\/p>\n<h2>A Real Estate Career is Born<\/h2>\n<p>\u201cA friend of mine had decided he was going to change careers,\u201d Summers explained. \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m going to take the real estate test and become a real estate agent,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cI thought, \u2018Oh, that sounds like a fun thing to do &#8211; maybe I\u2019ll do it with you.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>They took their test-prep classes together and tested together. Well, the first time anyway. \u201cHe took the test three times and never did pass, and I passed mine on the first try,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>This is when she realized she found real estate to be really interesting and that it could be a fun job.<\/p>\n<p>Summers went to work for a small firm, Stoneridge Realty, as one of the brokerage\u2019s first agents. She stayed with them for four years and then decided she wanted something closer to home.<\/p>\n<p>She landed at Windermere Real Estate, where she\u2019s still working and is, in fact, the broker of record, overseeing 20 full-time and about 10 referral agents. The \u201cboss\u201d who hired her is now an agent and working under her broker\u2019s license.<\/p>\n<h2>Challenges<\/h2>\n<p>I asked Summers what her biggest challenge is right now. \u201cHaving buyers that are ready to buy but not being able to find a home for them,\u201d she answered without hesitation. \u201cInventory is low, and it\u2019s frustrating for them to watch interest rates going up and not be able to find the right thing to pull the trigger,\u201d Summers said.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s hard for Summers as an agent, as well. \u201cI can\u2019t really help them with that because the product is just not there,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<h2>Marketing<\/h2>\n<p>Summers is an all-around marketer. She\u2019s fortunate to get a lot of referrals, but she swears by her Market Leader products.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to listings, she pulls out all the stops in her marketing campaigns, utilizing YouTube videos, single property websites, text-capture, QR codes on her signs, virtual tours and farming around the area.<\/p>\n<h2>Those All-Important Past Clients<\/h2>\n<p>Any agent who enjoys a large base of referrals knows the value of staying in touch with past clients, and Summers is no exception. She utilizes her Market Leader drip email campaign to reach out to clients, and this year she will hold her first client appreciation party.<\/p>\n<p>Summers was an early adopter of Market Leader products, jumping on the bandwagon before it was even a bandwagon \u2013 a decade ago. In fact, the company she subscribed to was called HouseValues.com, soon to become Market Leader.<\/p>\n<p>She says that 90 percent of her non-referral business comes from Market Leader, via House Values, her drip campaigns and her website, which she calls her most valuable tool.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA bunch of times I\u2019ve had people call me and say, \u2018Amy, this is Mary Jane,\u2019 or whatever, \u2018Thank you for sending me the listings all these years. You know that one you sent me today at 123 Main Street?\u2019 and I\u2019m thinking I have no idea who you are,\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cThe name sounds slightly familiar, but they feel like they have this close relationship with me because Market Leader has been sending them this stuff for like four years.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>The Best Part of the Job<\/h2>\n<p>I asked Summers to tell me about the best part of her job and she didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cThe people,\u201d she says. \u201cI enjoy meeting interesting people and there are very few of my clients that I don\u2019t like. They\u2019ve been great, wonderful people.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Some real estate agents just seem to be born to do real estate.
