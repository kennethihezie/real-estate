I have to admit, it\u2019s a bit disconcerting to conduct an interview over the phone with a woman who sounds exactly like Sara Palin. The similarity in cadence and inflection is uncanny. But still \u2013 a Texan pointing out someone else\u2019s accent?<\/p>\n<p>Benton grew up in Kodiak, Alaska, and moved to Anchorage as a teenager. A third generation real estate agent, she started her career working for her dad in 2005. Although she considered other careers, she\u2019s glad she settled on the family business. \u201cIt\u2019s really great to be able to carry on that legacy,\u201d Benton remarked.<\/p>\n<h2>Biggest Career Challenge Right Now<\/h2>\n<p>Benton\u2019s career trajectory was foretold back in 2010 when she was crowned Rookie of the Year for the entire state of Alaska. Today, her challenges revolve around putting together her team.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPatience in training and recruiting talent, and being organized about the execution of this team plan,\u201d takes most of her time, she said. Benton takes care of generating leads for the team while her listing specialist also manages the buyer team. Then there are two transaction coordinators and a marketing coordinator to help with administrative tasks.<\/p>\n<h2>Speaking of Marketing<\/h2>\n<p>Benton\u2019s team relies heavily on Internet lead generation. \u201cUltimately, what I do is promote my website through social media and other ways, to drive traffic to my website,\u201d she explained. \u201cRight now my team is selling four to five houses a month, and they\u2019re converting about 2 to 2.5 percent of the new leads I\u2019m getting within the first 60 days. The challenge is that I need to get this team up and running and recruit more members,\u201d Benton said.<\/p>\n<h2>Real Estate Aside<\/h2>\n<p>Outside of her hectic business schedule, Benton enjoys supporting Catholic Social Services in Anchorage and spending time with her three children.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cProbably one of the best parts of having a team is that when I was alone I was working 14 hours a day, seven days a week, and now I get to see my kids and it\u2019s awesome,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Oh my gosh, they\u2019re so cute!\u2019\u201d she said, chuckling.<\/p>\n<p>One of her family\u2019s favorite outings is returning to her roots. \u201cI like to take them home to Kodiak and explore.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>The One Tool That is Most Critical<\/h2>\n<p>I asked Benton which tool she considers most critical to her business. \u201cMy website. My whole business all comes from that website and how much traffic I can drive to it,\u201d she explained.<\/p>\n<p>The NAR statistics that point to how few agents get business from their websites confounds Benton. \u201cYou get what you put in. Just like everything. If I put everything into postcard marketing I\u2019d be getting a lot of postcard marketing stuff,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I put it all into advertising in magazines, I\u2019m sure I\u2019d get leads from that. But I don\u2019t put anything anywhere else because my websites are so inexpensive for me to do everything; I do to get traffic there.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Benton credits MarketLeader products &#8211; especially her CRM &#8211; with a lot of her success. \u201cWhen I was a buyer\u2019s agent I sold about six houses a year. Now, it\u2019s completely different \u2013 I have a nice house, a nice car. I have a team now. I don\u2019t have to show houses anymore. It\u2019s crazy how it\u2019s changed things.<\/p>\n<h2>The Best Part of Waking Up<\/h2>\n<p>The best part of going to work every day for Benton is working with her team. \u201cI love being successful through other people,\u201d she began. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot more fun for me than me selling a lot of houses.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m learning that it\u2019s so much more rewarding. When one of my buyer\u2019s agents sells a house and I get to give him that commission check \u2013 it\u2019s just amazing to be able to provide a good life for other people besides myself. I think that\u2019s my favorite part.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Read more about how <a href=\"http:\/\/files.marketleader.com\/pdfs\/CaseStudy-KatrinaBenton.pdf\">Katrina Benton succeeds with Market Leader<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Katrina Benton &#8211; who works for Keller Williams Realty, Alaska Group &#8211; was recently in Texas, and somebody told her she has an \u201cAlaskan accent.\u201d \u201cI was like, \u2018What the heck is that?\u2019\u201d she said, laughing.
