These one-day marketing and technology seminars for brokers and agents stressed that making a difference in the neighborhood usually makes a difference in the pocketbook.<\/p>\n<p>For example, attendees \u201cgot\u201d the importance of social media when Dale Chumbley, an agent with <a href=\"https:\/\/prunw.com\/\">Prudential NW Properties<\/a> in Vancouver, Washington said social media for generated 40 percent of his business. His blog \u201c365 Things to Do in Vancouver, Washington\u201d has become a national model and features basic information about the Vancouver area without attempting to sell anything.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt simply got people interested, and I listened,\u201d Chumbley said. \u201cIt was a way for them to participate. For me, it could eventually become a way to meet a person face-to-face. That\u2019s my goal with all social media \u2013 to eventually set up a face-to-face meeting.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>An important element of the Reboot series was that portions were aimed at social media non-believers and presented by former non-believers.<\/p>\n<p>Michael McClure, chief executive of <a href=\"https:\/\/professionalone.com\/\">Professional One Realtors<\/a>, thought Twitter \u201cwas the dumbest, most narcissistic thing ever invented.\u2019\u2019 Now, 18 months later, it\u2019s the backbone of his business.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s all about consistent content creation,\u201d McClure said. \u201cIt\u2019s about relationships, not the transaction.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>When I started writing about reverse mortgages for seniors 10 years ago, the most successful loan reps said that industry was all about providing information and hand-holding with no expectations of an immediate transaction. Today\u2019s residential real estate marketing is much the same.<\/p>\n<p><em>Tom Kelly is a syndicated columnist and talk show host.
