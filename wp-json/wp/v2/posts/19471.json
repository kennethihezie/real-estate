She runs 6 miles every morning and skis or surfs on her breaks from work.<\/p>\n<p>Brennan grew up north of Boston but left home shortly after getting married. The couple ended up in Jackson Hole, Wyo., then Salt Lake City, Park City and finally Newport Beach, on the sunny Southern California coast.<\/p>\n<p>Brennan\u2019s dream as a child was to be a flight attendant. The dream never became reality because she\u2019s too tiny \u2013 \u201cI never hit 5 feet,\u201d she said, laughing. At the time, to become a flight attendant a woman had to be at least 5 feet, 2 inches.<\/p>\n<p>That didn\u2019t stop her from flying, though. But we\u2019ll get to that in a minute.<\/p>\n<h2>College Days<\/h2>\n<p>Brennan obtained her master\u2019s degree in education and went into a career as a speech pathologist.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I lived in Utah I became the head of the speech and hearing department for the state training school, which is where the developmentally disabled people live,\u201d she recalled. She considered going for a doctorate but her husband\u2019s success prompted her to rethink the idea.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy husband went into repping hard goods, and he was skiing and travelling and making a lot of money, and I was not,\u201d she explained. \u201cI felt maybe I was missing something, so I quit my job and started repping. I started out with little knit hats at $12 a dozen and backpacks, and from there worked up to some major brands.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At one point during her career the couple bought an airplane and Brennan got her pilot\u2019s license. \u201cI\u2019d fly my samples to the buyers for them to look at,\u201d she remarked. \u201cWe got caught in clear air turbulence over the Tetons and decided that if we got down, we would sell the plane. So, we bought a sailboat because I can swim, but I can\u2019t fly,\u201d she said, laughing.<\/p>\n<h2>Real Estate Beckons<\/h2>\n<p>Once upon a time, MLS listings came in the form of a huge book, like a telephone directory, with black-and-white thumbnail images. The books were closely guarded by agents, much as the MLS database is today.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI started looking for property in Newport,\u201d Brennan recalls, \u201cbut my broker would not let me look at the book. I told him how much easier it would be if I could go through it and tell him what I wanted to see, but he wouldn\u2019t let me. So I got my real estate license so I could look at my own book,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>She was quickly smitten by everything about being an agent. \u201cI loved the fact that every day you had the opportunity to do anything you wanted,\u201d she said. \u201cYou could work as hard as you wanted. No one could tell you what to do.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Today<\/h2>\n<p>When asked about her biggest challenges today, 28 years after getting her license, Brennan offered me a job.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI need an assistant and I need someone to help me with these leads,\u201d she remarked. \u201cI have 4,000 leads on this program and 3,000 leads on another. I physically can\u2019t get to them. You available?\u201d she said, laughing.<\/p>\n<p>Brennan overseas a team of five and has tried to get them interested in working her leads. \u201cI\u2019ve tried &#8211; you know, \u2018here are a few leads\u2019 &#8211; but they don\u2019t get instant gratification from them, so they let them die,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<h2>Successes<\/h2>\n<p>Brennan credits Market Leader\u2019s leads for most of her success. \u201cMy money is better spent not on my own webpage &#8211; who cares where I come up on Google? I\u2019m Google-able. But I\u2019d much rather pay Market Leader the money to have them send me somebody,\u201d she said. It helps that she\u2019s an ace at converting leads \u2013 and actually finds the task enjoyable.<\/p>\n<p>Brennan became acquainted with Market Leader products in 2002. \u201cThe beauty of Market Leader is that I get quality leads; they\u2019re exclusive leads,\u201d she explained.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, she finds Market Leader\u2019s leads invaluable to not only her business but also her peace of mind. \u201cI don\u2019t worry, I come to work every day so excited, and I\u2019m on safari \u2013 who\u2019s my next victim? And they\u2019re all sitting here waiting,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe one feature I love about their process is when a person looks at a property online, I can go to that property and I can see who has looked at it. So I can work that house \u2013 talk to the people about this house and not be scattered. I can be focused on a group. I have other lead sources and they don\u2019t have that feature,\u201d she concluded.<\/p>\n<h2>Is She Ready to Hang Up the Shingle?<\/h2>\n<p>I asked Brennan where she sees herself a decade from now. She has mixed emotions about retirement. \u201cI probably have three to five years left in the business. But I don\u2019t want to get bored,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t go from Mach 5 like I am, down to zero.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Like most boomers, though, she\u2019s prioritizing what\u2019s important in life. She jogs every morning and takes monthly trips to surf in Hawaii or to fly fish with her husband.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen dramatic changes in this last year or so with friends who have passed away, and my dad at 90 just had a small stroke. It makes me keenly aware of time,\u201d she explained.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cUp until this point, I\u2019d get up in the morning and run 6 miles and I wasn\u2019t 60-something \u2013 until I looked in the mirror,\u201d Brennan reflects. \u201cBut things and people in your environment are so finite. Then you start thinking, \u2018OK, maybe I <em>can<\/em> go out to lunch when I want to eat; I don\u2019t have to sit here,\u201d she theorizes.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I have a lot of stress, but it\u2019s good stress. I\u2019m never done with what I\u2019m doing. I don\u2019t sit down and rest. So, it\u2019s all good. There are obstacles along the way, but it\u2019s all good.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Poster girl for the baby boomer generation, Coleen Brennan took up surfing when she was 50.
