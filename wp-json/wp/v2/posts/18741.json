Instead, right out of college he began flipping houses. From there he moved right into residential sales, so real estate is all he\u2019s ever known.<\/p>\n<p>The flipping occurred in Dallas. When he moved back to Colorado in 1997 to be with the lady he fell in love with, he left his flipping network behind, so he decided to sell residential real estate instead.<\/p>\n<p>Today, he\u2019s the broker\/owner of <a href=\"http:\/\/forcoloradohomes.com\">Metrobrokers<\/a> in Highlands Ranch, Colo. \u201cI like the idea of a boutique office because we\u2019re locally owned, so the money stays local; it doesn\u2019t go out to a national franchise,\u201d King explained. \u201cI get to control things and tailor them the way they work in Denver, not nationwide.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Challenges<\/h2>\n<p>With the real estate market changing so rapidly we asked King to talk to us about some of the challenges he\u2019s facing right now. One of the things he\u2019s having a tough time dealing with is the unprofessionalism of some agents.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere are some really good agents in our business \u2013 they really get it, they really care, and they aren\u2019t out there just to make a buck,\u201d he says. \u201cSure, they\u2019re making a living. Most of us are trying to make a good living. There are some agents, though, that just lack professionalism,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo, professional communication can be a challenge when working with them.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Not one to point fingers, King quickly adds that another big challenge for him is keeping in touch with past clients. \u201cI\u2019m terrible at it,\u201d he confessed. \u201cI do some things, but not nearly as consistent as I should. That\u2019s my challenge. It\u2019s definitely my weak point, but I do have a company that\u2019s helping me address that as we speak,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<h2>Marketing<\/h2>\n<p>Despite not reaching out to former clients as much as he thinks he should, King is fortunate to have a business based largely on referrals from past clients. Imagine what it will be like when he starts a client retention program!<\/p>\n<p>Although he loves all of Market Leader\u2019s products, it\u2019s the IDX that rocks his world. In fact, it\u2019s what sold him on Market Leader products. \u201cIt was the most accurate IDX search engine that I could find for my clients to use outside of the MLS,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<h2>What\u2019s to Like About Real Estate<\/h2>\n<p>King, like so many other agents, enjoys the personal interaction with his clients. \u201cWorking with people, it\u2019s always something different,\u201d he began. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with everyone from someone who works on the manufacturing line of a box manufacturer to the CEO of a multinational corporation.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve worked with some of the largest construction companies in the world, real estate attorneys and even other agents. I get people of all types, and that\u2019s what\u2019s fun,\u201d King concluded.<\/p>\n<p>What he likes more than anything though, at this point in his career, is the time he can allot to be with his family. \u201cI\u2019d rather hang out with them than anybody else,\u201d he admitted.<\/p>\n<p>King admits he\u2019s not out to set the real estate world on fire at this point in life &#8211; a decision he and his wife made when the market tanked. Instead of \u201cworking the crazy hours,\u201d he says, he now spends time coaching his sons\u2019 baseball teams.<\/p>\n<p>His wife, Kim, by the way, is his inspiration for just about everything King does. \u201cShe\u2019s an incredible example and resource for our boys and for me. She\u2019s a huge, huge reason for my success,\u201d King said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAmy and I have been together since she graduated from high school. She\u2019s much younger than me, but she knocked my socks off right away,\u201d King said, laughing. They\u2019ve been married for 13 years, and King says, \u201cI got lucky \u2013 I married up. I had no idea how well I was doing, but as time goes on I realize, wow, I\u2019m really lucky.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Native Coloradan Adam King grew up dreaming of being a chiropractor.
