My palms sweat, my heart races, and if I were a nail-biter, I probably wouldn\u2019t have any left. You\u2019d think that after a few successes agents would lose the listing presentation jitters, but for some of us, they never abate.<\/p>\n<p>Some older coaches will tell you this is the reason you need scripts and dialogs. But, unless you\u2019ve had theatrical training, scripts and dialogs typically come off sounding canned and unprofessional.<\/p>\n<p>What you need is preparation. Being fully, 100-percent prepared for a presentation is the only way to feel confident that you can not only swing it, but that you\u2019ll crush the competition.<\/p>\n<p>While I know that you don\u2019t need a complete walk-through on how to prepare for a listing presentation, I\u2019d like you to consider a few dos and don\u2019ts.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Do the Basics<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Dress the part. This doesn\u2019t mean you need to wear a suit to every listing presentation. In fact, you\u2019ll feel pretty silly if you do and your potential clients are selling a ranch. Wear something similar to what you assume these folks will be wearing. Just as you\u2019d most likely wear clean jeans and boots to a ranch listing, wear a pair of nice slacks or a skirt, and a casual yet stylish shirt when you visit a tract home.<\/li>\n<li>Make one last call to the homeowners to ensure that all parties will be present. If the wife also needs to sign the listing agreement, it\u2019s a waste of time to show up if she won\u2019t be there.<\/li>\n<li>Arrive on time. Yeah, I know this one\u2019s pretty basic, but you\u2019d be surprised how many agents are chronically late \u2013 even for this important job interview.<\/li>\n<li>Turn off your cell phone. Please. Turn. It. Off.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>2. Don\u2019t Procrastinate<\/h2>\n<p>Don\u2019t wait until the last minute to prepare your presentation. That\u2019s a recipe for disaster. Give yourself time to ensure that all your figures are correct, that your presentation is professional, and that it shows off your marketing acumen so well that potential clients wouldn\u2019t dream of listing with anyone else.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Don\u2019t Be Vanilla<\/h2>\n<p>As you prepare your listing presentation, remember that each seller is different and each home is different \u2013 especially to the homeowner.<\/p>\n<p>Everything in your presentation should be customized to this particular seller and this particular home. Leave the generics to the agents you\u2019re competing against. Don\u2019t skimp on colors, graphics and quality photos. Show \u2013 don\u2019t tell \u2013 the sellers that you are the consummate marketer. Make them lust after your sample marketing plan.<\/p>\n<p>The materials you leave the seller should be concise but attention-grabbing, and so valuable they\u2019d never dare to throw them away.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Do Take Notes<\/h2>\n<p>Even if you\u2019re just faking it, have a notepad or iPad in front of you and take notes on everything the seller says that you feel is important to him or her.<\/p>\n<p>Nothing beats a rapt audience when someone is trying to relay important information, and taking notes on what\u2019s being said makes you appear completely absorbed.<\/p>\n<h2>5. Do Always Assume the Close<\/h2>\n<p>Sometimes, the most challenging part of the listing presentation is deciding when to assume the close. At times, it seems that the opportunity will never present itself. But it will \u2013 even if it\u2019s as you\u2019re walking out the door.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Would you like some tips on how to prepare your home for the market, or do you want to sell it as-is?<\/li>\n<li>Do you want me to hold an open house, just a broker\u2019s open, or both?<\/li>\n<li>Would you like a flyer box on the yard sign, or just the sign?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>All of these questions assume that you\u2019ll be listing the home. They assume the close. Before he or she knows it, the seller will be answering your questions, and also assuming you\u2019ll be listing the home.<\/p>\n<h2>6. Don\u2019t Forget the Paperwork<\/h2>\n<p>Yup, I\u2019ve done it. And I\u2019ll bet you know somebody else who has too. You are going to get the listing, so not only bring the paperwork with you, have it filled out as well.<\/p>\n<p>Although we don\u2019t expect these tips to beat the Xanax that may be required to overcome the listing presentation jitters, they <em>will<\/em> help you to prepare, and preparation is one thing that <em>does <\/em>instill calm. When you\u2019re ready, and you know it, you\u2019ll be unbeatable.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I don\u2019t know about you, but listing presentations make me nervous.
