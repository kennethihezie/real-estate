Right now they have four of 30 planned buildings,\u201d Hansson continues. \u201cWe have a bio-med center that is working with A&amp;M and GlaxoSmithKline (a new vaccine facility) that\u2019s just come in. This is what\u2019s driving College Station,\u201d she boasts.<\/p>\n<p>College Station is an adopted hometown for Hansson; she was born and raised in San Francisco where her grandfather was an architect and builder. \u201cAbout 600 of his buildings still remain,\u201d said Hansson. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of where my love of real estate came from.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>She didn\u2019t always have a thing for real estate. She spent some time as a rack jobber in the music industry (doing store setups for record labels) and 25 years in international corporate agency travel.<\/p>\n<p>By the time her daughter grew up and moved on with her life Hansson realized that the travel industry had changed as well, and not for the better. That\u2019s when she decided to take the real estate licensing exam.<\/p>\n<h2>Challenges<\/h2>\n<p>I asked Hansson what challenges she faces in this, her eighth year in real estate. \u201cI have to say my biggest challenge is staying on top of all the new things coming out,\u201d she began. \u201cMaking sure that I\u2019m right there with it \u2013 not getting comfortable with the old stuff. To me, you have to keep up with technology; that\u2019s where it\u2019s at.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe other thing is, I\u2019m still growing my business,\u201d Hansson continued. \u201cI\u2019m continuing trying to establish myself, as a notable and respected Realtor\u00ae. My most immediate challenge, though, is that my husband has left the oil fields and we have become a team,\u201d she concluded.<\/p>\n<p>For now, it\u2019s just she and Tom, her husband, and two virtual assistants.<\/p>\n<h2>Marketing<\/h2>\n<p>The team utilizes supermarket cart ads, which work quite well in their market. \u201cI know that the cart advertising is working,\u201d Hansson claimed. \u201cThis is a small enough town where I run into people who recognize me. I was waiting to have my cell phone repaired and a lady there looked at me, smiled and waved and she said, \u2018You\u2019re a Realtor\u00ae, aren\u2019t you?\u2019<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAnd, of course, we\u2019ve got Market Leader,\u201d she said. \u201cTo be honest with you, I would not give up Market Leader. It works. It really works,\u201d Hansson continued. \u201cTheir program just makes it really easy to make that contact and to keep it up. Market Leader has all the tools I need to work the leads.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I asked her how Market Leader products have impacted her business. \u201cWith Market Leader I have doubled my business in the last year and a half. I would be lost without them,\u201d she replied.<\/p>\n<h2>The Best Part of Real Estate<\/h2>\n<p>Hansson enjoys the freedom that a real estate career affords. She also likes the people that she meets. \u201cI love the people. They are so diverse, and if you take the time, they\u2019re not just somebody to help you get a check,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re amazing. We get them from all over the world. I have learned that everybody has something to contribute. I\u2019ve had the cowboys, I\u2019ve had the intellectuals and, if you listen, they\u2019re all great people. They really are.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Hansson, donning her College Station booster hat again continues. \u201cIt has been a phenomenal experience. My husband and I always felt that what we wanted to do was live in a small town that had the things that we needed and things that we liked, yet only being an hour and a half away from a big city,\u201d she said. \u201cWe stopped and we took a look around and &#8211; oh, my gosh, this is exactly what we have here in College Station.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you want to know anything about College Station, Texas, talk to Stephanie Hansson of \u00a0Cortiers Real Estate\u00a0\u2013 a one-woman College Station booster club. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you what\u2019s interesting about College Station \u2013 in addition to Texas A&amp;M \u2013 the medical facilities that are coming in here are incredible,\u201d she begins. \u201cI mean, [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":27,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_et_pb_use_builder":"","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":""},"categories":[78,83],"tags":[190,106,275,56],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/19971"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/27"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=19971"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/19971\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=19971"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=19971"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.marketleader.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=19971"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
