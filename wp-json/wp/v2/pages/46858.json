Any terms defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended (Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7\u00a7 1798.100 to 1798.199), and any related regulations or guidance provided by the California Attorney General (\u201cCCPA\u201d), including \u201cpersonal information\u201d and \u201cbusiness purposes\u201d carry the same meaning in this Section [11].<\/p>\n<p>(b) ML will not collect, use, retain, disclose, sell, or otherwise make personal information of California consumers available for ML\u2019s own commercial purposes or in a way that does not comply with the CCPA.

ML will not attempt to or actually re-identify any previously aggregated, deidentified, or anonymized data and will contractually prohibit downstream data recipients from attempting to or actually re-identifying such data.<\/p>\n<h3>11.1 Assistance with Your CCPA Obligations<\/h3>\n<p>(a) ML will reasonably cooperate and assist you with meeting the your CCPA compliance obligations and responding to CCPA-related inquiries, including providing a template privacy policy for any website hosted by ML on your behalf, responding to verifiable consumer requests, taking into account the nature of ML\u2019s processing and the information available to the ML.\u00a0 ML\u2019s provision of a template privacy policy does not constitute and is not a substitute for legal advice.<\/p>\n<p>(b) ML will notify you immediately if it receives any complaint, notice, or communication that directly or indirectly relates either party&#8217;s compliance with the CCPA related to the Contracted Business Purposes. Specifically, ML will notify you within 15 working days if it receives a verifiable consumer request under the CCPA.<\/p>\n<h3>11.2 CCPA Warranties<\/h3>\n<p>(a) Both parties will comply with all applicable requirements of the CCPA when collecting, using, retaining, or disclosing personal information of California consumers.<\/p>\n<p>(c) Service Provider warrants that it has no reason to believe any CCPA requirements or restrictions prevent it from providing any of the Contracted Business Purposes or otherwise performing under this Agreement. ML will promptly notify you of any changes to the CCPA&#8217;s requirements that may adversely affect its performance under the Agreement.<\/p>\n<h3>11.3 No Subcontracting<\/h3>\n<p>ML will not use a subcontractor to provide the Contracted Business Services.<\/p>\n<h3>12. Submissions<\/h3>\n<p>You agree that any materials, including but not limited to questions, comments, suggestions, ideas, plans, notes, drawings, original or creative materials or other information regarding ML or the Site or Service provided by you in the form of postings on the Site or Service, e-mail, or other communication or submission to us, or, are unsolicited and non-confidential.

The mere display on or through the Site or Service of such Third Party Content does not in any way imply, suggest, or constitute any sponsorship, endorsement, or approval by ML of any third party or any affiliation between any such third party and ML. Furthermore, in using and accessing the Site or Service, you agree that ML is in no way responsible for the timeliness, completeness, or accuracy of Third Party Content. ML\u2019s display of specific Third Party Content does not suggest a recommendation by ML of the third party or any products or services offered by the third party. Your interaction with any third party accessed through the Site or Service (whether online or offline) is at your own risk, and ML will have no liability with respect to the acts, omissions, errors, representations, warranties, breaches or negligence of any such third party or for any personal injuries, death, property damage, or other damages or expenses resulting from your interactions with the third party.<\/p>\n<p>The Site or Service may also contain references or links to third-party properties, such as websites and other online services, not controlled by ML. ML provides such references and links solely as a convenience to you and such references and links should not be considered endorsements or recommendations of such third-party properties. You acknowledge and agree that ML is not responsible for any aspect of the information or content contained in any third-party properties. You agree that ML is not responsible for any injury, harm, damages, or negative experience you may encounter by accessing, visiting, or using such third-party properties. If you access, visit, or use any third-party properties referred to on the Site or Service, you do so at your own risk.<\/p>\n<p>For the avoidance of doubt, this Agreement applies solely to the Site and Service and does not apply to any third party website that may be accessed via third party links on the Site or Service. We encourage you to review the third party agreements of any third party website you choose to access, as their agreements may differ from ours.<\/p>\n<h3>15.

Limitation of Liability<\/h3>\n<p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in no event shall ML or any of its affiliates, partners, officers, employees, agents, contractors, successors, or assignees be liable to you (including any of your partners, officers, employees, agents, contractors, successors, or assignees) for any DIRECT, indirect, special, incidental, exemplary, punitive, or consequential damages, whether arising in contract, equity, tort, or otherwise (including breach of warranty, negligence, and strict liability in tort), including, without limitation, damages arising from delay, loss of goodwill, loss of or damage to data, interruption in use or availability of data, loss of use of money or use of products, lost profits, revenue or savings (actual or anticipated), or other economic loss ensuing from or in connection with (a) the Site or Service; or (b) any products and services offered through the SITE OR SERVICE, even if ML has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

These remedies are in addition to any other remedies ML may have at law or in equity.<\/p>\n<h3>19. Copyright Infringement<\/h3>\n<p>We take copyright violations very seriously. We may remove material from the Site or Service that appears in our sole discretion to infringe upon the copyright or other intellectual property rights of others, and we will terminate the access rights of any repeat infringer.
